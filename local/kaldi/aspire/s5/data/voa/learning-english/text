DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE UNITED STATES OFFERING VACCINES ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAD GOTTEN THEIR FIRST SHOT BUT TODAY CAMBODIA IS SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT FULLY VACCINATED

ABLE TO HOLD THE SUMMER OLYMPICS WHICH OPENED IN JULY JAPAN DID NOT START OFFERING VACCINES UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY BECAUSE IT REQUIRED ADDITIONAL TESTING ON JAPANESE PEOPLE THE MOVE WAS WIDELY CRITICIZED AS UNNECESSARY BUT THEN IT STARTED MAKING PROGRESS THEN PRIME MINISTER YOSHIHIDE SUGA BROUGHT IN MILITARY MEDICAL WORKERS TO OPERATE BIG VACCINATION CENTERS IN TOKYO AND OSAKA IT EASED LAWS

INFORMATION COMES FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER A DEGREE FROM A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE TO BE AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD A GOOD JOB EMPLOYERS HAVE USED THE CREDENTIAL TO HELP CHOOSE BETWEEN JOB CANDIDATES EXPERTS WHO STUDY LABOR AND HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE SAID A COLLEGE DEGREE TELLS BUSINESSES THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE BASIC WORK SKILLS BUT BY TWENTY NINETEEN THE NUMBER OF ADULTS WITH COLLEGE DEGREES INCREASED TO THIRTY SIX PERCENT THAT IS A RISE OF EIGHTY PERCENT OVER THIRTY YEARS A TWENTY NINETEEN STORY IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL NEWSPAPER CALLED THIS INCREASE DEGREE INFLATION THAT MEANT THE CREDENTIAL HAD BECOME LESS VALUABLE BECAUSE IT WAS SO COMMON HOWEVER MANY BUSINESSES STILL USE A COLLEGE DEGREE AS A FILTER IN CHOOSING POSSIBLE WORKERS WHILE MORE AMERICAN WORKERS HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE THAN IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THERE ARE STILL MILLIONS OF EXPERIENCED WORKERS WHO DO NOT HAVE ONE PEOPLE WHO STUDY LABOR SAY DEPENDENCE ON A COLLEGE DEGREE CREATES A NEEDLESS BARRIER BYRON AUGUSTE IS ONE OF THEM AUGUSTE IS AN ECONOMIST AND A LABOR EXPERT HE WAS AN ADVISER TO FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA IN TWENTY FIFTEEN HE HELPED START A COMPANY CALLED OPPORTUNITY@WORK IT AIMS TO HELP SKILLED WORKERS IN THE U S WHO DO NOT HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES FIND GOOD JOBS AUGUSTE TELLS THE STORY OF HIS FATHER WHO TOOK COMPUTER CLASSES HIS FATHER THEN WENT ON TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL COMPUTER PROGRAMMING CAREER BUT HE DID NOT HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE AUGUSTE CALLS WORKERS LIKE HIS FATHER STARS IT STANDS FOR SKILLED THROUGH ALTERNATIVE ROUTES THAT MEANS THEY USE

WROTE AN OPINION PIECE FOR THE WASHINGTON POST NEWSPAPER HE LATER SPOKE ABOUT HIS WORK IN A PODCAST HE SAID THE COLLEGE DEGREE FILTER CREATES A SKILLS GAP THE LACK OF A DEGREE MAKES EMPLOYERS THINK THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH WORKERS TO DO SOME JOBS BUT IN FACT THERE ARE WORKERS WITH THE NEEDED SKILLS MOST OF THE SKILLS WE USE AT WORK WE LEARN ON THE JOB NOT IN SCHOOL SO IF WE STOP PEOPLE FROM HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE ON THE JOB WELL THEN OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO WORK OUR WAY INTO A SKILLS GAP AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE SOME JOBS CLEARLY REQUIRE SPECIAL DEGREES AND TRAINING SUCH AS THE PROFESSIONS OF MEDICINE OR LAW HOWEVER THERE ARE MILLIONS OF GOOD WORKERS IN THE U S WHO HAVE VALUABLE EXPERIENCE SAID CRISTIAN SIRERA HE WORKS WITH AUGUSTE AT OPPORTUNITY AT WORK SIRERA SAID THEY MAY HAVE JOBS AT LARGE STORES LIKE WALMART AND COULD MOVE INTO BETTER JOBS WITH A LITTLE SPECIAL TRAINING SIRERA SAID MANY OF THESE PEOPLE SPEAK ENGLISH AND ANOTHER LANGUAGE HE GAVE AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN SPEAK BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH HE SAID AN IMMIGRANT HAS SKILLS PEOPLE CANNOT LEARN IN COLLEGE LIKE PATIENCE AND NOT TAKING THINGS TOO PERSONALLY AND HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF HUMOR ABOUT LIFE IN GENERAL AS YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT A DIFFERENT CULTURE A DIFFERENT COUNTRY A DIFFERENT EVERYTHING A COMPANY HE SAID THAT IS FLEXIBLE IN ITS HIRING METHODS CAN

FOUR YEAR DEGREE REQUIREMENTS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET BETTER JOBS SIRERA MOVED TO THE U S FROM SPAIN WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE HE FOUND THAT IF HE WANTED TO HAVE A GOOD JOB HE WOULD NEED TO FIND A WAY TO FINISH COLLEGE HE DID THAT BUT IT WAS NOT EASY HE STARTED BY ATTENDING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE MANY PEOPLE WILL STILL NEED TO PUSH THEMSELVES TO GET A COLLEGE DEGREE HE SAID HOWEVER COMPANIES LIKE OPPORTUNITY AT WORK ARE ASKING BUSINESSES TO RECONSIDER THEIR JOB REQUIREMENTS A RECENT STORY BY THE HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW NOTED THAT DURING THE COVID NINETEEN HEALTH CRISIS SOME COMPANIES REMOVED A COLLEGE DEGREE FROM THEIR LIST OF JOB REQUIREMENTS BEFORE THAT A TWENTY EIGHTEEN STORY BY CNBC NOTED THAT COMPANIES INCLUDING GOOGLE APPLE IBM AND STARBUCKS WERE REMOVING COLLEGE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS FROM SOME JOB LISTINGS SIRERA SAID MANY OF THOSE JOBS ARE SHOW YOUR WORK JOBS LIKE WRITING PROGRAMMING FOR COMPUTERS BUT HE SAID THERE ARE STILL OTHER JOBS WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORK EXPERIENCE WITHOUT A DEGREE CAN SUCCEED ALSO HE SAID COMPANIES NEED TO TELL THEIR EMPLOYEES ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO GET BETTER JOBS AND TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR GOOD WORKERS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THEM SIRERA CALLED ON EMPLOYERS TO OFFER JOBS WITH MID LEVEL PAY AND GOOD JOB POSSIBILITIES TO STARS HE SAID THAT STARS ANSWER WHEN EMPLOYERS SEND A STRONG SIGNAL THAT THEY NEED WORKERS WITH SKILLS AND DO NOT REQUIRE A COLLEGE DEGREE BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW EMPLOYERS ARE FAILING TO TURN THE SIGNAL ON AND COMMIT TO ACTION THAT HE ADDED PREVENTS STARS FROM TAKING ACTION AND KEEPS THEM ON THE SIDELINES I'M DAN FRIEDELL 
voa-06756f69-21cf-4579-b171-fb7776bbbf993 A RECENT STORY IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL NEWSPAPER LOOKED AT STUDENTS WHO WENT TO CELEBRATED UNIVERSITIES SUCH AS COLUMBIA AND NEW YORK UNIVERSITY IN NEW YORK CITY FOR ADVANCED DEGREES IN SUBJECTS LIKE ART FILM AND EVEN SOCIAL WORK MANY OF THE STUDENTS SAID THEY LEARNED A LOT HOWEVER WHEN THEY GRADUATED THEY WERE DEEP IN DEBT AND DID NOT THINK THEY WOULD FIND WORK THAT WOULD LET THEM PAY BACK THEIR LOANS AFTER GRADUATION MANY STUDENTS REPORTED OWING OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS MEANWHILE THEY WERE EARNING JUST FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ONE STUDENT WHO RECEIVED A MASTER OF FINE ARTS KNOWN AS AN MFA FROM COLUMBIA MATT BLACK TOLD THE NEWSPAPER HE WAS FINANCIALLY HOBBLED FOR LIFE AND OWED LENDERS CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS STUDENTS SAID THEY SPOKE WITH COLUMBIA ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF ADVANCED ARTS DEGREES BUT NEVER RECEIVED A REASONABLE ANSWER THE NEWSPAPER REPORTED EDUCATION EXPERTS SAY THESE SCHOOLS ARE VERY WEALTHY WITH LARGE ENDOWMENTS WHICH COULD BE USED TO PAY STUDENTS TUITION THE UNIVERSITIES HOWEVER PREFER TO ASK THE STUDENTS TO PAY THE FULL COST ONE FAMOUS SCHOOL YALE IS CHANGING THE SYSTEM ITS THEATER PROGRAM WILL BE FREE TO STUDENTS AFTER A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS DONATION FROM MUSIC AND MOVIE PRODUCER DAVID GEFFEN THE DATA FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL STORY CAME FROM THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND IT WAS RESTRICTED TO THE TWO YEARS AFTER A STUDENT GRADUATED WHEN REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UNIVERSITIES IN THE STORY WERE ASKED ABOUT THEIR GRADUATES FINANCIAL PROBLEMS MANY SAID TWO YEARS IS A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THEY SAID THEIR GRADUATES SLOWLY INCREASE THEIR EARNINGS OVER TIME IN SUBJECTS LIKE MATH MEDICINE SCIENCE AND COMPUTER PROGRAMMING ADVANCED DEGREES ARE OFTEN REQUIRED FOR FIRST YEAR JOBS HOWEVER IN MORE CREATIVE CAREERS LIKE WRITING MAKING MOVIES OR PAINTING PEOPLE CAN BE VERY SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT GETTING AN ADVANCED DEGREE KEVIN CAREY IS A HIGHER EDUCATION EXPERT FOR NEW AMERICA A PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH CENTER HE CALLED MASTER'S DEGREES A SCAM IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE WEBSITE SLATE DOT COM CHARGING PEOPLE A TON OF MONEY TO GO INTO ANY ARTISTIC CAREER IS OFTEN SUPER PROBLEMATIC HE SAID CAREY ALSO SAID SCHOOLS SAY WE NEED THE MONEY WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF THEIR MASTER'S DEGREES BUT EVERYONE NEEDS MONEY HE SAID ADDING IT IS A POOR DEFENSE EVEN IN CAREERS LIKE LAW OR BUSINESS ADVANCED DEGREES ARE NO GUARANTEE OF FINANCIAL SUCCESS THE SAME WALL STREET JOURNAL WRITERS LOOKED AT LAW SCHOOL GRADUATES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI IN FLORIDA THEY SAW RECENT GRADUATES OFTEN BORROWED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL TWO YEARS AFTER GRADUATION THEY WERE EARNING JUST FIFTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS SERGIO CASTILLO IS AN ACTOR IN NEW YORK CITY HE SAID HE OWES SO MUCH MONEY ON HIS STUDENT LOANS THAT HE NO LONGER PAYS THEM HE WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES AND THEN EARNED AN MFA FROM THE ACTORS STUDIO IN NEW YORK CITY HE DOES NOT EXPECT TO EARN A LOT OF MONEY FROM ACTING WAS HIS MFA WORTH THE COST I DO THINK IT WAS WORTH IT I DON'T PUT A PRICE TAG ON MY EDUCATION OR MY EXPERIENCE I THINK IT'S SORT OF UNFORTUNATE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE TAKE FOR GRANTED EDUCATION SO MANY PEOPLE PEOPLE LIKE MY MOTHER FOR EXAMPLE NEVER GOT TO GO TO COLLEGE CASTILLO SAID STUDENTS WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT AN ADVANCED DEGREE IN ART SHOULD BE SURE THEY ARE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY VALUE THE EDUCATION NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT MONEY OR TO BE FAMOUS THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO DON'T GO INTO IT FOR THAT REASON LYNNE ADRINE IS A FORMER TELEVISION PRODUCER WHO RUNS THE BROADCAST JOURNALISM GRADUATE PROGRAM IN WASHINGTON D C FOR SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY SHE SAID STUDENTS MUST ASK AN IMPORTANT QUESTION WHEN THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT GRADUATE SCHOOL IS IT WORTH THE INVESTMENT OF ALL THAT MONEY FOR THAT MASTER'S DEGREE AND WHAT IS IT GOING TO TURN INTO LATER IN SOME FIELDS PEOPLE MAY HAVE BETTER EXPERIENCES WORKING AS AN ASSISTANT THAN SPENDING MONEY ON GRADUATE SCHOOL ADRINE WARNED THAT THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE U S IS A SERIOUS ISSUE I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A RECKONING COMING IN TERMS OF COLLEGE TUITION IN GENERAL AND THE BANG FOR THE BUCK THAT ONE GETS SHE SAID KASIA PLAZINSKA IS A FILMMAKER IN NEW YORK CITY SHE CAME TO THE U S FROM POLAND TO STUDY ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO SHE ATTENDED GRADUATE SCHOOL BOTH AT BAYLOR UNIVERSITY IN TEXAS AND AT THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA SHE SAID SHE RECEIVED A LOT OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THOSE UNIVERSITIES WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF GRADUATE SCHOOL IN THE U S SHE DESCRIBED IT WITH ONE WORD INSANITY IT IS SO INSANE I MEAN I KNOW FRIENDS WHO ARE STUCK WITH THE DEBT AND LITERALLY THEY CAN'T THEY ARE NOT TAKING RISKS IN LIFE JUST EVEN CHANGING THE JOB BECAUSE THEY ARE SO AFRAID PLAZINSKA SAID ARTS GRADUATE PROGRAMS CAN HELP STUDENTS MEET AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH FELLOW ARTISTS WITH WHOM THEY CAN WORK THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREERS IT'S EVEN BETTER IF THE SCHOOL IS IN A PLACE LIKE NEW YORK OR LOS ANGELES THOSE INTERVIEWED DID NOT HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF COSTLY ADVANCED DEGREES IN CREATIVE SUBJECTS FOR SCHOOL TO BE OF VALUE PLAZINSKA SAID STUDENTS NEED TO REMEMBER WHY THEY STARTED MAKING ART IN THE BEGINNING IT'S FOR JUST FOR THE PURE PLEASURE OF CREATING AND FULFILLING MYSELF THIS WAY I'M DAN FRIEDELL 
voa-0c1f6f63-3615-4679-aa0f-742cea54cad33 HOW VALUABLE WOULD IT BE TO HAVE A GUARANTEED JOB FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES FEW JOBS COME WITH LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS FEDERAL JUDGES INCLUDING JUSTICES ON THE U S SUPREME COURT AND COLLEGE PROFESSORS ARE ON THE SHORT LIST PROFESSORS CAN EARN WHAT IS KNOWN AS TENURE THE IDEA OF TENURE GOT POPULAR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS AT SOME FAMOUS SCHOOLS DECIDED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO PROTECT PROFESSORS FROM OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE THE IDEA IS THAT A PROFESSOR WITH TENURE IS FREE TO TEACH OR DO RESEARCH EVEN IF THEIR STATE'S LEADER DOES NOT LIKE THE SUBJECT AS A RESULT IT IS RARE FOR A PROFESSOR WITH TENURE TO BE DISMISSED THOSE WHO ARGUE AGAINST TENURE SAY PROFESSORS MIGHT WORK HARD LEADING UP TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS A TENURE REVIEW AND THEN STOP WORKING AS HARD AFTER THEIR JOB IS SAFE IN ADDITION SOME EXPERTS WORRY THAT TENURE PROTECTS PROFESSORS WHO ARE ACCUSED OF BAD BEHAVIOR YOUNG PROFESSORS WHO ARE HIRED FOR JOBS WHERE TENURE IS A POSSIBILITY ARE SAID TO HAVE TENURE TRACK JOBS THEY OFTEN HAVE A REVIEW AFTER THEIR FIFTH YEAR IF THEY EARN TENURE THEN THEY HAVE A JOB THAT IS LARGELY GUARANTEED FOR AS LONG AS THEY WANT IT THE REVIEW IS EXTREMELY DETAILED PROFESSORS ARE JUDGED BY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY ON THE QUALITY OF THEIR TEACHING THE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THEY HAVE DONE IN THEIR SUBJECT AND BOOKS AND STUDIES THEY HAVE WRITTEN PROFESSORS AT OTHER SCHOOLS WRITE LETTERS AND PAST STUDENTS CAN ADD THEIR THOUGHTS THE IDEA OF TENURE HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS RECENTLY TWO WELL KNOWN BLACK PROFESSORS RECENTLY MADE PUBLIC DISPUTES THEY HAD WITH THE TENURE PROCESS AT SOME FAMOUS UNIVERSITIES CORNEL WEST IS A WELL KNOWN PROFESSOR WHO TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES AT HARVARD IN FEBRUARY HE SAID HARVARD REJECTED HIS REQUEST TO BE CONSIDERED FOR TENURE ALTHOUGH HE HAD A GOOD FIVE YEAR REVIEW WEST HAD A TENURED POSITION AT HARVARD IN THE PAST BUT LEFT THE SCHOOL IN

NEW OFFER AND DECIDED TO JOIN HOWARD UNIVERSITY IN WASHINGTON D C SHE WILL USE MONEY FROM OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS TO START A JOURNALISM CENTER THERE THE TENURE REVIEW IS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT IN A PROFESSOR'S CAREER YOUNG PROFESSORS OFTEN WORRY THEY WILL NOT DO ENOUGH TO GET TENURE AND THEY THEN WORRY THAT BEING DENIED TENURE WILL BE A BAD MARK ON THEIR RECORD ONE YOUNG PROFESSOR GERI KERSTIENS TEACHES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN SANTA CRUZ SHE SAID TWITTER IS FULL OF COMMENTS FROM PROFESSORS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR TENURE REVIEW BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF US AND NOT AS MANY JOBS BUT BEING DENIED TENURE CAN BE A NEW BEGINNING SOME PROFESSORS ARE REJECTED FOR TENURE BUT GO ON TO FIND A BETTER PLACE TO WORK ONE PROFESSOR FOUND A POSITION THAT OFFERED JOB SECURITY AND SUPPORTED HER BEST WORK ANNE BARANGER IS AN EXPERIENCED CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY HALF OF HER JOB IS TENURED AND HALF IS NOT HER STATUS SHE SAID IS UNUSUAL SHE SAID HER JOB IS SECURE BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE GETTING RID OF HALF A PERSON AND NOT THE OTHER HALF BEFORE MOVING TO CALIFORNIA SHE TAUGHT AT UNIVERSITIES IN ILLINOIS AND CONNECTICUT SHE NOW HELPS GRADUATE STUDENTS THINK ABOUT THEIR CAREER PATH MOST START TO PLAN THEIR CAREERS IN THEIR THIRD OR FOURTH YEAR AT THAT POINT THEY DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO BECOME A PROFESSOR OR WORK FOR A BUSINESS THAT HIRES CHEMISTS STUDENTS ALSO DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO CENTER THEIR CAREER ON TEACHING OR RESEARCH IN THE PAST UNIVERSITIES OFTEN GAVE EQUAL WEIGHT TO A NEW PROFESSOR'S ABILITY TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH TEACH AND SERVE THE UNIVERSITY IF A PROFESSOR WAS NOT GOOD IN ONE OF THOSE AREAS THEY WOULD BE DENIED TENURE NOW HOWEVER SOME UNIVERSITIES THINK ABOUT HIRING PROFESSORS WHO CAN SPEND MORE TIME IN AREAS WHERE THEY ARE STRONG GERI KERSTIENS IS ONE OF BARANGER'S FORMER CHEMISTRY STUDENTS SHE JUST STARTED A TENURE TRACK JOB IN SANTA CRUZ KERSTIENS WILL TEACH CHEMISTRY BUT ONE OF HER MAIN JOBS IS TO HELP THE UNIVERSITY REVAMP ITS CHEMISTRY PROGRAM SHE SAID SHE WILL DO RESEARCH ON WAYS TO TEACH CHEMISTRY BUT SHE WILL NOT RUN A LABORATORY LIKE MANY PROFESSORS FINDING A JOB THAT CENTERED ON CHEMISTRY

COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN OREGON SHE WAS DENIED TENURE AT A DIFFERENT SCHOOL EARLY IN HER CAREER SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT OPPORTUNITIES SHE WOULD HAVE AFTER THAT NOW HOWEVER SHE IS HAPPY AT A COMMUNITY

EARLIER DISAPPOINTMENT IN RETROSPECT IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE I KIND OF ALWAYS WANTED TO TEACH AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE I THINK I'M EXACTLY WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AND PROFESSIONALLY IT'S A MUCH BETTER FIT BARANGER THE BERKELEY PROFESSOR SAID SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE NON TEACHING EMPLOYEES AT UNIVERSITIES CONSIDERED WITH THE SAME INTENSITY IT MIGHT MAKE THE UNIVERSITY

voa-4241136d-2149-4b0f-8660-49961c8a075e3 THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GIVING A RECORD AMOUNT OF PANDEMIC AID TO THE NATION'S SCHOOLS PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S ADMINISTRATION IS HOPING SCHOOLS USE THE MONEY TO IMPROVE DEEP PROBLEMS WITHIN THE NATION'S SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT MANY DISTRICTS SAY THEY HAVE MORE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS TO SOLVE FIRST DETROIT MICHIGAN IS A POOR CITY WITH A LONG STRUGGLING SCHOOL SYSTEM THE CITY IS USING THE FEDERAL MONEY TO FIX BUILDINGS WITH STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THE DISTRICT IS ALSO USING SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT MONEY TO HIRE MORE TEACHERS HAVE SMALLER CLASSES AND PROVIDE MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT AT LEAST HALF OF THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL AID IS BEING USED TO REPAIR SCHOOL BUILDINGS NIKOLAI VITTI LEADS DETROIT PUBLIC SCHOOLS HE SAID FOR DECADES WE HAVE BEEN INEQUITABLY FUNDED TO DEAL WITH THE ENORMOUS NEEDS THAT POVERTY AND RACIAL INJUSTICE HAVE CREATED IN OUR CITY WITH THE PANDEMIC MONEY HE SAID THE DISTRICT WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO WORK TOWARD FIXING THE PROBLEM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS PUSHED SCHOOLS TO MAKE LARGE CHANGES WITH THE MONEY EDUCATION SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA HAS CALLED IT A TIME FOR BIG IDEAS HE SAID DISTRICTS COULD USE THE MONEY TO LESSEN INEQUALITY BUT MANY LARGE CITY DISTRICTS ARE PUTTING THE PANDEMIC MONEY TOWARDS SHORT TERM NEEDS SCHOOLS HAVE USED THE AID TO HIRE MEDICAL WORKERS PUT MORE BOOKS IN LIBRARIES AND BRING BACK ART CLASSES SO FAR THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF MAJOR CHANGE SAID MARGUERITE ROZA SHE IS A SCHOOL FINANCE EXPERT WITH GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY PART OF THE PROBLEM SHE SAID IS THAT THE AID WAS GIVEN TO SCHOOLS WITH FEW REQUIREMENTS ABOUT HOW TO SPEND IT THE MONEY WAS GIVEN AS BLANK CHECKS TO EVERY ONE OF THESE DISTRICTS ROZA SAID AND MANY ARE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO THE PANDEMIC AID IS BIGGER THAN ANYTHING AMERICAN SCHOOLS HAVE SEEN BEFORE IT TOTALS ONE HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT SPENDS ON SCHOOLS IN A USUAL YEAR CONGRESS HAS SENT THE FUNDING TO SCHOOLS IN THREE ROUNDS SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC THE LAST AND LARGEST ROUND TOTALS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING LITTLE TO STUDY HOW SCHOOLS ARE USING THE MONEY SOME STATES ARE REQUIRED TO RELEASE SPENDING PLANS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT MANY ARE NOT SOME REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS HAVE PUSHED FOR A NEW LAW THAT WOULD GIVE THE PUBLIC MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW DISTRICTS ARE USING THE MONEY REPORTERS WITH THE ASSOCIATED PRESS LOOKED AT HOW MUCH MONEY WAS GIVEN TO ALMOST EVERY DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY THEY TRACKED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SENT TO STATES SINCE LAST YEAR THE MEDIAN AID GIVEN TO DISTRICTS WAS NEARLY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT BUT THAT AMOUNT DIFFERS WIDELY BY DISTRICT AND STATE THE AP REPORTS THE MEDIAN FUNDING PER STUDENT IN LOUISIANA AND WASHINGTON D C WAS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT IN UTAH IT WAS ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED POORER DISTRICTS RECEIVED MUCH MORE MONEY DETROIT RECEIVED THE MOST AMONG BIG CITY DISTRICTS AT MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT IT WAS FOLLOWED BY PHILADELPHIA WITH THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT AND CLEVELAND AT MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SCHOOLS HAVE THREE YEARS TO SPEND THE LATEST ROUND OF FUNDING BUT DISTRICTS SAY THAT IS A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TO USE SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY SOME SCHOOL OFFICIALS DO NOT WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON THINGS THEY CANNOT PAY FOR AFTER THE FEDERAL AID IS GONE IN ST PAUL MINNESOTA THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IS GETTING THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FUNDING DISTRICT LEADER JOE GOTHARD SAYS THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TO SPEND THE MONEY LIMITS HOW HE CAN USE IT THE DISTRICT HAS HIRED SOME NEW TEACHERS BUT IT IS MOSTLY USING THE MONEY FOR THINGS LIKE BUILDING REPAIRS AND REPLACING LIBRARY BOOKS DISTRICTS ACROSS THE U S HAVE SPENT THE SUMMER DEBATING HOW TO SPEND THE NEW MONEY THEY HAVE FACED PRESSURE FROM GROUPS OF PARENTS AND OTHERS SOME FAMILIES WANT MORE MONEY TO GO TO SPECIAL EDUCATION OTHERS WANT MORE TEACHER TRAINING THAT EXAMINES RACISM AT THE SAME TIME DISTRICTS ARE FACING PRESSURE TO INCREASE TEACHER PAY SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOL DISTRICT IS RECEIVING THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PANDEMIC AID THE DISTRICT'S TEACHERS UNION HAS CALLED FOR SMALLER CLASS SIZES WHICH WOULD MEAN MORE TEACHERS AS WELL AS PAY INCREASES THE UNION IS NOT ASKING THAT THE FUNDING SHOULD COME FROM THE FEDERAL AID BUT THE UNION IS MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE EXTRA FUNDING MEANS THE DISTRICT CAN OFFER PAY RAISES THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS SAYS THE FEDERAL AID SHOULD CENTER ON IMPROVING SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND CLASSROOM SUPPORT BUT PRESIDENT RANDI WEINGARTEN ALSO SAID PAY RAISES ARE NEEDED TO KEEP TEACHERS FROM QUITTING AFTER A DIFFICULT YEAR ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN FOR SCHOOLS IS STATE FUNDING THERE IS WORRY THAT THE FEDERAL MONEY WILL GIVE STATES REASON TO CUT FUTURE EDUCATION BUDGETS IN DETROIT VITTI SEES A CHANCE TO ASK FOR MORE STATE FUNDING HE HOPES TO SHOW THAT THE FEDERAL AID HAD IMPROVED THINGS FOR STUDENTS AND INCREASED GRADUATION RATES WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SHOW CLEAR OUTCOMES FROM THIS INVESTMENT HE SAID HE WANTS TO PROVE TO STATE LAWMAKERS THAT SIMILAR FUNDING SHOULD BE CONTINUED IN AN EQUITABLE WAY I'M DAN NOVAK AND I'M DAN FRIEDELL

REPAIR BUSINESS AND A USED COMPUTER BUSINESS IN THAT BUILDING A MAN DEALS DAILY WITH LIFE AND DEATH SETH VIDDAL AND HIS EMPLOYEES HAVE BUILT A BURIAL CONTAINER OR VESSEL RECENTLY THEY TOLD REPORTERS FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT THEY HOPE THIS VESSEL WILL BE THE START OF A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TYPE OF BURIAL SCIENCE THIS PROCESS WILL INCLUDE THE NATURAL BREAKDOWN OF THE HUMAN BODY THOSE IN THE BURIAL BUSINESS CALL THIS BODY COMPOSTING IT IS A NATURAL PROCESS WHERE THE BODY IS RETURNED TO AN ELEMENTAL LEVEL OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SAID VIDDAL HE SAID IT IS SIMILAR TO COMPOSTING OF FOOD AND YARD WASTE THIS IS THE SAME PROCESS BUT DONE WITH A HUMAN BODY INSIDE OF A VESSEL AND IN OUR CASE IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT ON SEPTEMBER SEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE COLORADO BECAME THE SECOND STATE AFTER WASHINGTON TO PERMIT HUMAN BODY COMPOSTING OREGON WILL PERMIT THE PRACTICE BEGINNING NEXT JULY IN WASHINGTON STATE THERE ARE THREE BUSINESSES LICENSED TO COMPOST HUMAN REMAINS TOGETHER THEY HAVE COMPOSTED AT LEAST EIGHTY FIVE BODIES SINCE THE LAW TOOK EFFECT IN MAY TWENTY TWENTY MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED UP FOR THIS SERVICE AS NATURAL FUNERALS BECOME MORE POPULAR VIDDAL CO OWNS THE NATURAL FUNERAL IN LAFAYETTE COLORADO SOON AFTER THE COLORADO LEGISLATION WAS SIGNED INTO LAW HE STARTED BUILDING THE VESSEL IN AN INDUSTRIAL PART OF TOWN THE VESSEL IS ABOUT TWO METERS LONG ABOUT ONE METER WIDE AND ABOUT ONE METER DEEP THE BOX IS LINED WITH WATERPROOF MATERIAL AND PACKED WITH WOOD CHIPS AND STRAW TWO LARGE WHEELS ON EITHER END ALLOW IT TO BE ROLLED ACROSS THE FLOOR THIS PROVIDES THE AIR AND MOVEMENT NEEDED FOR A BODY TO COMPOST THE VESSEL MUST REACH FIFTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS FOR SEVENTY TWO CONTINUOUS HOURS TO KILL ANY BACTERIA AND GERMS TEETH ARE REMOVED TO PREVENT POISONING FROM CHEMICALS USED IN TEETH REPAIR THEN AFTER ABOUT THREE MONTHS THE VESSEL IS OPENED AND THE SOIL IS EXAMINED FOR MEDICAL DEVICES THE REMAINING LARGE BONES ARE RETURNED TO THE VESSEL FOR ANOTHER THREE MONTHS OF COMPOSTING IN SIX MONTHS THE BODY WOOD CHIPS AND STRAW WILL TURN INTO SOIL FAMILY MEMBERS CAN KEEP THE SOIL TO USE IN THEIR YARDS HOWEVER COLORADO LAW FORBIDS SELLING IT AND USING IT TO GROW FOOD FOR HUMAN USE ALSO THE STATE ONLY PERMITS LICENSED FUNERAL HOMES AND CREMATORIES TO COMPOST HUMAN BODIES VIDDAL CALLS THE PROCESS AN EXCITING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY CHOICE HE ADDED THAT IN DEATH HE ALSO SEES LIFE COMPOSTING ITSELF IS A VERY LIVING FUNCTION AND IT IS PERFORMED BY LIVING ORGANISMS HE TOLD REPORTERS HE ADDED THAT THERE ARE BILLIONS OF MICROBES IN OUR BODIES AND WHEN LIFE ENDS THE LIFE OF THOSE MICROBES CONTINUES VIDDAL SAID BODY COMPOSTING SUCCESSFULLY TURNS THE BODY BACK INTO SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE EARTH HOWEVER NOT EVERYONE APPROVES OF BODY COMPOSTING THE COLORADO CATHOLIC CONFERENCE IS A GROUP OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHO AIM TO SHAPE PUBLIC POLICY THEY OPPOSE THE PROCESS THE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION SAID IN STATEMENTS THAT BODY COMPOSTING DOES NOT PROMOTE HUMAN DIGNITY SOME JEWISH RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE ALSO AGAINST BODY COMPOSTING THEY SAY IT VIOLATES JEWISH RELIGIOUS LAW OTHER OPPONENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A LACK OF RESEARCH THEY FEAR THE BODY COMPOST MIGHT POISON THE SOIL THEY ALSO FEAR MISUSE OF THE BODY SOIL WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH IT IF THEY TAKE IT ALL HOME SAID STACEY KLEINMAN SHE IS A BOARD MEMBER OF THE COLORADO FUNERAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THE GROUP HELPED TO WRITE THE LEGISLATION BUT HAS SAID IS NOT FOR OR AGAINST BODY COMPOSTING OPPOSITION ASIDE SEVERAL OTHER U S STATES ARE CONSIDERING BODY COMPOSTING MORE AMERICANS SEEM TO BE BECOMING OPEN TO GREEN BURIAL PRACTICES THIS PAST SUMMER THE CHOICE MUTUAL INSURANCE AGENCY ASKED ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AMERICANS HOW THEY WANTED THEIR BODIES TO BE DEALT WITH TRADITIONAL BURIAL AND CREMATION WERE THE COMMON ANSWER HOWEVER ELEVEN PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD CHOOSE A BURIAL INVOLVING A NATURAL PROCESS BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY ONLY FOUR PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD CHOOSE THAT CHOICE MUTUAL DID NOT SPECIFICALLY ASK ABOUT BODY COMPOSTING BUT THE RESULTS SEEM TO SHOW AN INCREASED INTEREST IN MORE NATURAL AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY OPTIONS THE NATURAL FUNERAL CHARGES SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR BODY COMPOSTING COMPARED WITH TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR FLAME CREMATION VIDDAL NOTES THAT A TRADITIONAL BURIAL AND SERVICE IN THE DENVER AREA CAN COST MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET COMPOSTED ANY BODIES BUT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED UP AND PAID FOR THE SERVICE MICAH TRUMAN IS HEAD OF THE COMPANY RETURN HOME NEAR SEATTLE WASHINGTON SO FAR HIS COMPANY HAS COMPOSTED SIXTEEN BODIES TRUMAN SAID BODY COMPOSTING IS NEW SO HE SAID IT IS A MATTER OF CHANGING HEARTS AND MINDS RIGHT NOW BUT HE HAS BEEN SURPRISED BY HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TEACH US HOW TO DIE BETTER IT HAS BEEN REALLY POWERFUL FOR US TRUMAN SAID HE ADDED THAT YOUNGER

TELEVISION YEAH I THINK FOR A STUDENT FROM ASIA OR ANYWHERE OUTSIDE AMERICA I THINK IT COULD BE A VERY INTERESTING SHOW TO WATCH BHALA APPROVED OF THE SHOW'S ATTEMPT TO SHOW AN ASIAN WOMAN AS A UNIVERSITY LEADER SHE NOTED THAT U S UNIVERSITIES ARE CURRENTLY HAVING REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DIVERSITY OH'S PARENTS CAME TO CANADA FROM SOUTH KOREA IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SPEAKING TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS SHE SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT HER CHARACTER HAD A KOREAN FIRST NAME HER BEST KNOWN TELEVISION CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN NAMED CRISTINA AND EVE TO BE ACTUALLY ABLE TO PUT A KOREAN NAME AND HAVE ALL THE CHARACTERS SAY YOUR NAME IT REALLY APPEALED TO ME OH SAID THE CHAIR IS THE FIRST MOVIE OR TELEVISION SHOW IN A NUMBER OF YEARS TO TELL A STORY ABOUT A PROFESSOR AT AN AMERICAN COLLEGE SOME CRITICS SAID IT IS THE FIRST TO DO SO SINCE THE WONDER BOYS THAT FILM CAME OUT OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO THE CHAIR SHOWS TWO SIDES OF KIM'S LIFE AS A UNIVERSITY LEADER AND AS A SINGLE PARENT WHILE BHALA IS A YOUNG PERSON SHE HAS EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIA BECAUSE SHE FOLLOWED HER FATHER WHO IS A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS SHE SAID SHE IS GLAD THE SHOW TRIES TO SHOW CURRENT COLLEGE LIFE THE SHOW DEFINITELY HAS KIND OF THIS CURRENT PERSPECTIVE WHICH WAS REFRESHING TO SEE IN A SHOW ABOUT ACADEMIA BELSKY THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PROFESSOR SAID IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT KIM LEADS THE SCHOOL'S ENGLISH DEPARTMENT HE PROPOSED THAT A SHOW ABOUT ENGINEERING OR CHEMISTRY MIGHT BE VERY DIFFERENT SO I THINK YOU REALLY HAVE TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES VERSUS THE REST OF THE CAMPUS BELSKY ALSO PROPOSED THAT WHILE THE SHOW IS GETTING NOTICED IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY ONLY CONNECT WITH A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS NOT MANY PEOPLE IN THE U S ATTENDED SCHOOLS LIKE THE ONE IN THE CHAIR BHALA THOUGHT ONE PART OF THE SHOW WAS OVERSTATED THE IDEA THAT OLDER PROFESSORS ARE OUT OF TOUCH AND UNABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE CURRENT COLLEGE STUDENTS I'VE BEEN REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE PROFESSORS WHO ARE ENERGETIC BRILLIANT AND LIKE ON TOP OF ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THEIR FIELDS I'M DAN FRIEDELL

voa-8d08209e-389b-4733-8bc6-0281cd3a5ed02 FROM VOA LEARNING ENGLISH THIS IS THE HEALTH AND LIFESTYLE REPORT PROGRAMS USING ANIMALS TO CALM PATIENTS AND REDUCE TENSION ARE CALLED ANIMAL THERAPY IN THE UNITED STATES THESE TREATMENTS ARE POPULAR ALTHOUGH THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THEY WORK THERE ARE HOWEVER MANY STORIES ABOUT ANIMAL THERAPY HELPING PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE SOME CHILDREN HAVE A FEAR OF INJECTIONS THAT MAY MAKE GETTING THE COVID NINETEEN VACCINE A DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE SO SOME HOSPITALS USE THERAPY ANIMALS LIKE OLLIE A SIX YEAR OLD THERAPY DOG OLLIE IS HELPING CHILDREN AT RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA OVERCOME THEIR FEAR OF VACCINE SHOTS ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN IS NINE YEAR OLD AVERY SMITH AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL SHE CRIED OVER HER FEAR OF THE VACCINE THEN OLLIE CAME IN AND SAT AT HER FEET AVERY TOLD A REUTERS REPORTER ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE IT HELPED ME BECAUSE I NEVER HAD A COVID VACCINE BEFORE SAID AVERY SHE ADDED I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT FELT LIKE BUT WHEN I SAW THE DOG IT HELPED ME CALM DOWN EARLY IN NOVEMBER CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES AGED FIVE TO ELEVEN WERE ABLE TO GET THE VACCINE EVER SINCE THEN OLLIE AND FOURTEEN OTHER DOGS HAVE BEEN HELPING THEM GET VACCINATED AT THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL THEY ARE PART OF A THERAPY PROGRAM PAID FOR BY A PET SUPPLY COMPANY EVEN BEFORE THE VACCINE THERAPY DOGS WERE ALREADY BEING USED AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL SOME CHILDREN AT THE HOSPITAL ARE FIGHTING CANCER OR OTHER SERIOUS DISEASES KRISTIN GIST IS A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD DOG THERAPY VOLUNTEER AND A FORMER HOSPITAL PROGRAMS DIRECTOR SHE IS ALSO OLLIE'S OWNER GIST SAID PARENTS WILL SOMETIMES HOLD THE DOG AND SEEM TO FEEL BETTER TOO HOWEVER SOME EXPERTS SAY THERE IS A LACK OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE PROVING THAT ANIMAL THERAPY IMPROVES A PATIENT'S MEDICAL CONDITION ONE SUCH EXPERT IS HAL HERZOG HE IS A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT WESTERN CAROLINA UNIVERSITY HE HAS BEEN STUDYING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN HUMANS AND ANIMALS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS HERZOG TOLD VOA THAT AN ANIMAL CAN DISTRACT A PATIENT OTHER THINGS HE ADDED SUCH A FAVORITE TOY MIGHT HAVE THE SAME EFFECT SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FOR SHORT TERM PREVENTING PAIN INTERACTING WITH A DOG CAN PUT YOUR MIND ON SOMETHING ELSE AND IN THAT CASE I SEE NO HARM IN DOING IT AND FOR SOME KIDS IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE HOWEVER HERZOG CRITICIZED THE USE OF ANIMALS AS A MEDICAL TREATMENT LIKE A DRUG HE SAID RESEARCH DOES NOT SHOW THAT ANIMAL THERAPY IS EFFECTIVE THERE'S BEEN TONS OF RESEARCH BUT MOST OF IT IS NOT VERY GOOD AND SOME STUDIES HAVE FOUND SOME OF THE BETTER STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT THERAPY DOGS DID NOT REALLY HAVE ANY IMPACT ON KIDS AND ADULTS THAT WERE PUT IN STRESSFUL EXPERIMENTAL SITUATIONS HERZOG SAID THE POOR RESEARCH METHODS COME IN MANY FORMS MANY STUDIES DO NOT USE A CONTROL GROUP A CONTROL GROUP HELPS SCIENTISTS UNDERSTAND IF AN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT HAS ANY EFFECT SOME STUDIES DO NOT CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF THE DOG HANDLERS THEY ARE OFTEN NICE PEOPLE AND COULD ALSO BE HELPING THE PATIENT PEOPLE INVOLVED IN ANIMAL THERAPY RESEARCH HERZOG SAID OFTEN BELIEVE IN IT SO THEIR PERSONAL OPINIONS MAY AFFECT THE RESEARCH HERZOG ALSO TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED THE FILE DRAWER PROBLEM THIS IS WHEN A RESEARCHER DOES NOT GET THE RESULTS THEY WANT AND PUT THE FINDINGS INTO A FILE DRAWER OR A PLACE THEY DO NOT LOOK OFTEN SOMETIMES HE SAID THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST MANY STUDIES ON THE HEALTHY IMPACTS OF PET OWNERSHIP AND ANIMAL THERAPY ARE PAID FOR BY THE PET INDUSTRY HOWEVER HERZOG SAID EVEN WHEN THOSE STUDIES FIND A LACK OF PROOF SOME IN THE MEDIA STILL REPORT ON THE FINDINGS IN A GOOD WAY HERZOG SAID THE MEDIA OFTEN REPORTS ON SUCH STUDIES INCORRECTLY HERZOG WROTE ABOUT ONE OF THE BEST STUDIES ON DOG THERAPY HE EXPLAINED THAT THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AT FIVE BIG AMERICAN HOSPITALS IT LOOKED AT THE EFFECTS OF THERAPY DOGS ON CHILDREN WITH CANCER THE STUDY FOUND NO CLEAR BENEFIT FROM THE THERAPY DOGS THE MEDIA HOWEVER REPORTED THAT THE STUDY DID FIND BENEFITS AS A RESULT PEOPLE MIGHT THINK ANIMAL THERAPY AFFECTS LONG TERM HUMAN HEALTH MORE THAN IT DOES HERZOG HAS PUBLISHED REPORTS ON THIS SUBJECT IN THE MAGAZINE PSYCHOLOGY TODAY HERZOG SAID HE IS NOT AGAINST THE USE OF ANIMALS IN THERAPY HE SHARES A STORY OF HIS OWN SON A NURSE IN A HOSPITAL'S CRITICAL CARE AREA THAT HOSPITAL ALSO BRINGS IN ANIMALS TO HELP NOT THE PATIENTS BUT THE HOSPITAL WORKERS HIS SON SAYS EVERYONE LOVES THE VISITS HOWEVER HERZOG THINKS DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF USING ANIMALS AS A MEDICAL TREATMENT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO PUSH DOGS ANIMALS AS MEDICINE THAT WE SHOULD HOLD THEM TO THE SAME STANDARD AS WE DO DRUGS FOR SOME PEOPLE EVEN IF THERE IS NOT PROOF THE SMILES AND HAPPY DISTRACTION MAY BE ENOUGH LAST YEAR WHEN HOSPITALS PUT COVID NINETEEN RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE THE DOG VISITS AT RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL STOPPED THEY RESTARTED IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WAS NOTHING IT WAS SILENT THE KIDS WERE BORED SAID CARLOS DELGADO A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE HOSPITAL SO THANK GOD HE TOLD REUTERS WE WERE ABLE TO START BRINGING THE PROGRAM BACK DELGADO ADDED THAT EVEN A SHORT THREE MINUTE VISIT WITH A DOG MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN THE DAY OF A PATIENT AND THAT'S THE HEALTH & LIFESTYLE REPORT I'M ANNA MATTEO

STUDENT LIVING SPACE AT COLLEGES STUDENTS LIVE IN BUILDINGS CALLED DORMITORIES OR DORMS FOR SHORT WHEN COMPLETE THE BUILDING WILL BE CALLED MUNGER HALL THE UNIVERSITY HOPES TO OPEN THE DORM IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE SCHOOL IS IN SANTA BARBARA A SMALL CITY ON THE PACIFIC COAST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY KILOMETERS NORTH OF LOS ANGELES IF THE PLAN CONTINUES BASED ON CURRENT DESIGNS IT WILL BE ELEVEN FLOORS HIGH AND PROVIDE BEDS FOR FOR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS ON A SMALL PIECE OF LAND MOST OF THE SLEEPING AREAS FOR STUDENTS WILL NOT HAVE WINDOWS THE BUILDING ONLY HAS ONE LARGE ENTRANCE ON EACH SIDE THE DORM IS CLOSE TO THE SCHOOL'S SPORTS FIELDS BUT FAR FROM THE REST OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE COAST WITH SO MANY STUDENTS THERE IT WOULD BE THE EIGHTH MOST DENSELY POPULATED LIVING AREA IN THE WORLD SIMILAR TO A PART OF DHAKA BANGLADESH THE BUILDING PLAN BECAME PUBLICLY KNOWN RECENTLY MANY PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED BY THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND THE LACK OF WINDOWS SAID MATT POLDBERG HE HAS ALREADY COMPLETED HIS STUDIES AT UCSB HE SAID ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF GOING TO SCHOOL IN SANTA BARBARA IS CLOSENESS TO THE OCEAN AND BEAUTIFUL AREAS NOT HAVING WINDOWS SEEMED STRANGE HE SAID AND BEING ON A PIECE OF LAND FAR AWAY FROM THE BEST PARTS OF THE SCHOOL WAS STRANGE TOO YOU KNOW TO BUILD SUCH A WINDOWLESS JOYLESS SEEMING PLACE IT SEEMED LIKE A WASTE TO NOT HAVE IT AT LEAST BE LIKE TEN STEPS FROM THE BEACH LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IS THERE MUNGER SAID THE DESIGN PUTS MORE IMPORTANCE ON PUBLIC SPACES HE WANTS STUDENTS TO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME AWAY FROM SLEEPING AREAS SO THEY CAN MEET EACH OTHER AND WORK TOGETHER THE BUILDING WILL HAVE LARGE COOKING EATING AND GATHERING SPACES THE PROJECT WAS NOT GETTING MUCH ATTENTION UNTIL OCTOBER WHEN ONE OF ITS ARCHITECTS DROPPED OUT CALLING IT DISTURBING DENNIS MCFADDEN WROTE A LETTER ON OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH CALLING THE PROJECT DESTRUCTIVE TO THE CAMPUS AND THE DESIGN UNSUPPORTABLE HE SAID HE WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE GROUP OF ADMINISTRATORS AND PROFESSORS STUDYING THE PROJECT DID NOT OBJECT HE SAID THE BUILDING WAS A RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM STUDENT HOUSING STANDARDS NEWS ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE NEW YORK TIMES CNN AND THE GUARDIAN ALL WROTE ABOUT MCFADDEN'S CONCERNS SOME CALLED THE PROJECT DORMZILLA AFTER THE JAPANESE MOVIE MONSTER GODZILLA MUNGER ANSWERED THE CRITICISM IN EARLY NOVEMBER HE TALKED WITH ARCHITECTURAL RECORD ABOUT THE PROJECT HE SAID THE ROOMS WITHOUT WINDOWS ARE QUITE ENDURABLE AND COMPARED THEM TO THE ROOMS ON LARGE VACATION BOATS KNOWN AS CRUISE SHIPS THAT DO NOT LOOK ONTO THE WATER HE CALLED THE BUILDING'S DESIGN SAFE AND ABLE TO MEET BUILDING REQUIREMENTS IN CALIFORNIA HE SAID HE THINKS UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE UNITED STATES WILL BUILD MORE BUILDINGS LIKE MUNGER HALL THE UCSB DESIGN IS SIMILAR TO A PROJECT MUNGER FUNDED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN STUDENTS HAVE MIXED OPINIONS ABOUT IT UCSB LIKE MUCH OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH LOW COST HOUSING THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE IN SANTA BARBARA THAN THE NUMBER OF HOMES AVAILABLE THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR A UNIVERSITY WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS ATMIKA IYER WRITES FOR THE DAILY NEXUS A STUDENT NEWSPAPER AT UCSB SHE SAID THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS FOR STUDENTS SOME STUDENTS MUST LIVE FAR AWAY FROM CAMPUS AND DRIVE OVER AN HOUR TO GET TO SCHOOL OTHERS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO SLEEP IN THEIR CARS RIGHT NOW THE UNIVERSITY PAYS HOTELS SO STUDENTS CAN LIVE THERE SHE SAID ONE PROBLEM IS THAT WHILE THE UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN WELCOMING MORE STUDENTS IT HAS NOT BEEN BUILDING MORE HOUSING WHILE THE SCHOOL SEES MUNGER HALL AS AN ANSWER IYER SAID MOST STUDENTS DISAGREE THE GENERAL CONSENSUS AMONG MOST OF THE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN SPEAKING WITH IS THAT THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA UCSB HOWEVER POSTED A QUESTION AND ANSWER PAGE ONLINE RECENTLY AND SAID WE EXPECT MUNGER HALL TO BE HIGHLY DESIRABLE NOLAN GRAY IS A RESEARCHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES HE STUDIES URBAN PLANNING HE RECENTLY WROTE ABOUT MUNGER HALL FOR BLOOMBERG NEWS SERVICE HE SAID THAT THE MEGA DORM WITH A COST OF OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS MAY BE UCSB'S ONLY WAY OUT OF AN EXTREME HOUSING PROBLEM BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE SO GOOD GRAY SAID SCHOOLS HAVE NO TROUBLE FINDING STUDENTS BECAUSE THE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE SO COSTLY TO LIVE IN STUDENTS OFTEN SHARE SMALL ROOMS SOME EVEN HAVE TO LEAVE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE NEAR THEIR CLASSES GRAY CALLED MUNGER HALL A TRADE OFF WHERE STUDENTS GET TO GO TO SCHOOL IN A BEAUTIFUL PLACE IN EXCHANGE FOR SLEEPING IN A SMALL WINDOWLESS ROOM LIVING IN A DORM IS NOT UNLIKE LIVING IN A SMALL APARTMENT IN A REALLY NICE CITY RIGHT WHEN YOU LIVE IN A CITY THE PARK IS YOUR LAWN THE RESTAURANTS ARE YOUR DINING ROOM THE BARS ARE YOUR PARLORS THE LIBRARY IS YOUR OFFICE GRAY SAID HE THOUGHT MUNGER HALL HAS A SIXTY FIVE OR SEVENTY PERCENT CHANCE OF BEING BUILT AT UCSB IN THE COMING YEARS THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WORK HE ADDED IYER SAID THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEM RESTS NOT ONLY WITH THE UNIVERSITY BUT WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES CLOSE TO THE UNIVERSITY ALL THREE HAVE NOT DONE A GOOD JOB OF MEETING GROWING DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND HOUSING IN ADDITION IYER SAID THERE ARE NO OTHER CURRENT PLANS FOR STUDENT HOUSING UCSB IS SORT OF PUTTING ALL THEIR EGGS IN THIS ONE BASKET RIGHT MUNGER HALL IS THE ONLY PROPOSED SOLUTION THUS FAR IF MUNGER'S PROJECT GOES AHEAD IT WILL ONLY SOLVE THE HOUSING PROBLEM FOR A SHORT TIME THE SCHOOL SAID IT IS ONLY A PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR STUDENTS POLDBERG THE UCSB GRADUATE SAID HE THINKS STUDENTS WOULD STILL RATHER GO TO SANTA BARBARA THAN TO OTHER CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS I

voa-c2d985ff-6c75-4949-92b0-92aecc325abf3 THERE HAS BEEN A LONG LIST OF DIFFICULTIES WITH DISTANCE LEARNING DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ARE NOW SETTING UP MORE VIRTUAL LEARNING CENTERS THEY HOPE TO SERVE FAMILIES WHO FEEL REMOTE LEARNING WORKS BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN THIRTY EIGHT STATE EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS ANSWERED AN ASSOCIATED PRESS SURVEY THIS SUMMER THEIR ANSWERS SHOWED MORE PERMANENT VIRTUAL SCHOOLS AND PROGRAMS WILL BE IN PLACE IN THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR SOME PARENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS BUT THEY ALSO LIKE THE INDEPENDENCE THAT COMES WITH REMOTE SCHOOLING IN ADDITION SCHOOLS WANT TO IMPROVE ATTENDANCE THEY HAVE SEEN TOO MANY STUDENTS LEAVE FOR VIRTUAL SCHOOLS HOME SCHOOLING PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND OTHER CHOICES FEWER STUDENTS COULD MEAN LESS FINANCING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS DAN DOMENECH IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS HE SAID VIRTUAL SCHOOLING IS THE FUTURE SOME OF THESE STATES MIGHT BE DENYING IT NOW BUT SOON THEY WILL HAVE TO GET IN LINE BECAUSE THEY WILL SEE OTHER STATES DOING IT HE SAID AND THEY WILL SEE WHY IT IS A GOOD IDEA KAREN STRAUSS IS A PARENT IN THE U S STATE OF NEW JERSEY SHE LOST A BROTHER IN LAW TO THE PANDEMIC HER VACCINATED TEENAGER WILL RETURN TO SCHOOL IN PERSON BUT SHE WANTS HER FIVE YEAR OLD SON LOGAN AT HOME UNTIL HE CAN GET THE VACCINE

VIRGINIA BEFORE THE PANDEMIC MOST LOCAL VIRTUAL PROGRAMS OFFERED INDIVIDUAL CLASSES ONLY TO GRADES SIX TO TWELVE FEW OFFERED FULL TIME LEARNING BUT IN THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR ONE HUNDRED TEN OF VIRGINIA'S ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL USE VIRTUAL VIRGINIA A STATE OPERATED PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES ALL GRADES IT WILL PROVIDE SOME OR ALL OF THEIR FULL TIME VIRTUAL SCHOOLING SPOKESPERSON CHARLES PYLE SAID SO FAR MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS HAVE ENROLLED IN VIRTUAL VIRGINIA FULL TIME FOR THE FALL THAT COMPARES WITH JUST A LITTLE OVER FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR HE SAID IN TENNESSEE STATE OFFICIALS APPROVED TWENTY NINE NEW ONLINE SCHOOLS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR THAT IS MORE THAN TWO TIMES THE NUMBER CREATED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS SPOKESPERSON BRIAN BLACKLEY SAID LIKE MOST U S STATES NEW MEXICO IS REQUIRING SCHOOLS TO OFFER IN PERSON LEARNING THIS YEAR BUT THE RIO RANCHO PUBLIC SCHOOLS USED FEDERAL MONEY TO ADD THE REMOTE SPARRK ACADEMY FOR K FIVE GRADES A SURVEY FOUND NEARLY SIX HUNDRED OF THE SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENT FAMILIES WANTED TO CONTINUE VIRTUAL SCHOOLING THE SPREAD OF COVID NINETEEN'S DELTA VARIANT AND RISING INFECTION RATES HAVE CAUSED WORRY AT THE START OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR BUT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND EDUCATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SUGGEST RETURNING TO IN PERSON

FIRST COLLEGE DEGREE THE WELL KNOWN SCHOOLS IN THE SYSTEM INCLUDE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES UCLA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA – SANTA BARBARA THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IS RUN BY A BOARD OF REGENTS MOST ARE APPOINTED BY THE STATE'S GOVERNOR IN MID NOVEMBER THE BOARD OF REGENTS SAID IT WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND A GOOD REPLACEMENT FOR THE

THE COVID NINETEEN PANDEMIC MANY UNIVERSITIES DECIDED IT WOULD BE UP TO STUDENTS IF THEY WANTED TO SEND TEST SCORES WITH THEIR APPLICATIONS THEY ARE KNOWN AS TEST OPTIONAL SCHOOLS MEANING THE TEST SCORES ARE NOT REQUIRED ONE OF THE MOST WELL KNOWN SCHOOLS IN THIS GROUP IS THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO IN THE LAST TWO YEARS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES REPORTED GETTING MORE APPLICATIONS FROM STUDENTS IN GENERAL THEY HAVE ESPECIALLY RECEIVED MORE APPLICATIONS FROM THE MINORITY GROUPS CRITICS SAY THE TRADITIONAL STANDARDIZED TESTS DO NOT PREDICT HOW WELL STUDENTS WILL DO IN COLLEGE IN ADDITION THEY SAY SOME BUSINESSES CREATED COSTLY TEST PREPARATION CLASSES THAT NOT EVERY STUDENT CAN PAY FOR AS A RESULT THEY SAY RICH STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE WHITE OR ASIAN ARE IN A BETTER POSITION SUPPORTERS OF THE TESTS SAY THEY HELP SOME STUDENTS WHO HAVE TROUBLE GETTING GOOD GRADES IN HIGH SCHOOL SHOW THAT THEY CAN BE GOOD COLLEGE STUDENTS THEY WORRY THAT REMOVING THE TESTS COULD KEEP THOSE STUDENTS FROM GOING TO GOOD COLLEGES TWO YEARS AGO A GROUP THAT INCLUDED THE COMPTON UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA BROUGHT LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IT CALLED FOR THE UNIVERSITIES TO REMOVE THE TEST REQUIREMENT COMPTON HAS MANY BLACK AND HISPANIC STUDENTS WHO DO NOT APPLY TO COMPETITIVE COLLEGES IN MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE UNIVERSITY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GROUPS THAT BROUGHT THE CASE IT SAID IT WOULD STOP USING THE SAT AND ACT FOR THE FOUR YEARS ENDING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT ALSO AGREED TO PAY OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN LEGAL COSTS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THEN DECIDED TO STUDY WHETHER THE TESTS PERMITTED THE SCHOOL TO BRING IN A GROUP OF DIVERSE AND ABLE STUDENTS EACH YEAR THEIR STUDY SHOWED THAT STANDARDIZED TESTS AID IN PREDICTING STUDENT PERFORMANCE INCLUDING THEIR GRADES HOWEVER THE UNIVERSITY DECIDED TO CHANGE ITS TEST POLICIES ANYWAY OVER THE LAST YEAR THE STUDY GROUP CONSIDERED USING A TEST THAT IS GIVEN TO

GROUP LEADERS AT THE RECENT MEETING SHE SAID THE NEW TEST WOULD PROVIDE ONLY MODEST VALUE BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL GRADES IN PREDICTING HOW A STUDENT WOULD PERFORM IN COLLEGE IN ADDITION SHE SAID THE PROFESSORS IN THE STUDY GROUP WORRIED THAT ADDING HIGH STAKES TO THE SMARTER BALANCED TEST WOULD LEAD TO COMPANIES CREATING NEW COSTLY TEST PREPARATION CLASSES MICHAEL BROWN IS A LEADER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM CALLED THE PROVOST HE ANNOUNCED THE FINAL DECISION UC WILL CONTINUE TO PRACTICE TEST FREE ADMISSION NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE WITH THE MAJOR UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA PERMANENTLY REMOVING THE STANDARDIZED TESTS WILL OTHER UNIVERSITIES DO THE SAME JEREMY BAUER WOLF IS A REPORTER FOR HIGHEREDDIVE A WEBSITE THAT COVERS HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE U S HE SAID HE THINKS THEY WILL HIGHER EDUCATION IS VERY MUCH A CASE OF FOLLOW THE LEADER HE SAID COLLEGES DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS WANT TO ACT UNLESS THEY SEE THEIR PEERS DOING THE SAME THING THE U C SYSTEM VERY PUBLICLY DOING AWAY WITH THESE TESTS WILL REVERBERATE ESPECIALLY THROUGH CALIFORNIA BUT YOU KNOW OTHER OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT MIGHT BE LOOKED AT AS COMPETITIVE BAUER WOLF SAID UNIVERSITIES THROUGHOUT THE U S

IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH HIS STUDENTS IN ENGLISH SOMETIMES HE HAS TROUBLE TODAY THAT HE SAID IS ONE REASON WHY HIS OLD STUDENT ARISTIDE GUMYUSENGE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT PROFESSOR AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY OR MIT GUMYUSENGE WHO GREW UP IN RWANDA WILL START HIS CAREER AT MIT IN JANUARY HE IS ONLY THIRTY YEARS OLD GUMYUSENGE IS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING HE RECENTLY FINISHED ADVANCED RESEARCH AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA IF GUMYUSENGE DOES A GOOD JOB OVER THE FIRST FIVE YEARS HE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO BE A PERMANENT PROFESSOR AT MIT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH VOA GUMYUSENGE SAID HE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO OPENING THE ORGANIC MATERIALS FOR SMART ELECTRONICS LAB AT MIT HE IS CURRENTLY LOOKING AT STUDENTS FOR HIS RESEARCH TEAM GROWING UP IN RWANDA GUMYUSENGE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION HIS FATHER WAS A TEACHER AFTER ALL BUT HE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT TEACHING EVEN AFTER HIGH SCHOOL I STILL THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL GUMYUSENGE TOLD VOA HE ARRIVED IN THE U S IN THE AUTUMN OF TWENTY ELEVEN AFTER RECEIVING A SCHOLARSHIP TO WOFFORD COLLEGE IN SOUTH CAROLINA HE WAS PART OF THE RWANDA PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS PROGRAM GUMYUSENGE SAID IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE STARTED HIS ADVANCED DEGREE WORK AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN INDIANA THAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT A CAREER AS A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR HE IS PLANNING TO CONTINUE THE WORK HE DID AT PURDUE AND STANFORD ON ENGINEERING ELECTRONIC DEVICES HE SAID SOME OF THE THINGS PEOPLE SEE IN MOVIES SET IN THE FUTURE WHERE PEOPLE ARE WEARING SMART SUITS AND SMART DEVICES ARE GETTING CLOSE TO BECOMING REAL HE GAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A CONTACT LENS THAT CAN MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR IN THE BODY WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE ELECTRONICS THAT CAN BE MORE COMPATIBLE WITH THE BODY BOTH MECHANICALLY AND CHEMICALLY GUMYUSENGE IS WORKING TO CREATE MATERIALS THAT CAN MOVE ELECTRICITY IN THE SAME WAY THAT METALS IN COMPUTERS CHIPS DO NOW HE SAID THE NEXT THING IS FOR ENGINEERS

PROGRAMMING GUMYUSENGE SAID HE ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES AS A TEENAGER ABLE TO SPEAK WELL AND UNDERSTAND AMERICAN ENGLISH ACCENTS THANKS TO THE PROGRAMS HE SAID THE SLOWER SPEED OF THE LEARNING ENGLISH BROADCASTS HELPED HIM LEARN QUICKLY COMPARED TO NEWS AND MUSIC PROGRAMS IN ENGLISH THE ACTUAL LEARNING PROGRAM THE SPEED WAS ADJUSTED SO THAT PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF CAN PICK IT UP YOU DON'T GET THAT ONCE YOU HIT THE GROUND HERE IN THE U S REALLY THANKFUL FOR THE PROGRAM AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU ALL ARE DOING IN RWANDA HE WAS ABLE TO LEARN TO READ ENGLISH BUT IT WAS HARD TO FIND PEOPLE WHO COULD SPEAK WITHOUT AN ACCENT THE ANNOUNCERS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING IN RWANDA HAD AN ACCENT SO VOA HE SAID HELPED HIM LEARN AMERICAN ACCENTS SPEAKING ENGLISH HE SAID CAN HELP YOU GET A JOB IN ADDITION GUMYUSENGE SAID A LOT OF SCIENCE VIDEOS ARE IN ENGLISH SO STUDENTS CAN LEARN QUITE A BIT ON THEIR OWN BY FOLLOWING THEM AT WOFFORD HE FOUND A WAY TO TALK WITH AMERICAN STUDENTS ONE TOPIC HE LEARNED SO HE COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION THE STAR WARS MOVIES HE UNDERSTOOD IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO LEARN HOW TO SPEAK CONFIDENTLY WITH AMERICANS AT FIRST HE JUST LISTENED AND TRIED TO SPEAK THE SAME WAY AS HIS SCHOOLMATES I GUESS I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE I GOT HERE WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN SO I STILL HAD SOME FLEXIBILITY I GUESS IN THE BRAIN TO ALLOW MYSELF

TIGHTLY TO YOUR OLD LIFE AT HOME EXPERIENCE LIFE IN AMERICA WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE I KNOW PEOPLE WHO GET HERE AND CHANGE NOTHING ABOUT THEIR DAILY ROUTINE HE SAID THEY LIVE AS IF THEY'RE STILL

ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT FEWER INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS STUDIED IN THE U S OR TOOK CLASSES FROM U S UNIVERSITIES ONLINE DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR THAT ENDED LAST SPRING COMPARED TO THE YEAR BEFORE THOSE FINDINGS WERE RELEASED RECENTLY BY THE INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION IIE BASED IN NEW YORK CITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE U S STATE DEPARTMENT THE IIE PUBLISHED THE YEARLY OPEN DOORS REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE GROUP FOUND THAT STUDENTS ARE COMING BACK TO THE U S ABOUT FOUR PERCENT MORE STUDENTS CAME TO AMERICA FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR COMPARED TO LAST YEAR DURING A PRESENTATION MONDAY THE U S STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE U S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SAID THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC CHANGED EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE A LOT MATTHEW LUSSENHOP IS THE ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S BUREAU OF EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS HE SAID HE IS HOPEFUL ABOUT THE STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE OF THE WORLD'S EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY DURING THE LAST TWENTY MONTHS HE SAID THE U S GOVERNMENT KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE IS TO BUILDING A MORE UNDERSTANDING WORLD WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO EXPAND ACCESS TO GLOBAL LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN STUDENTS SCHOLARS AND RESEARCHERS IIE RESEARCH SHOWED THAT ABOUT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FEWER CHINESE STUDENTS STUDIED AT U S UNIVERSITIES LAST SCHOOL YEAR THAT WAS THE BIGGEST DROP CHINA SENDS THE MOST STUDENTS TO THE U S ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENT POPULATION IN AMERICA COMES FROM CHINA INDIA IS SECOND WITH EIGHTEEN PERCENT THE MOST POPULAR FIELDS OF STUDY FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ARE ENGINEERING MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCE OVER FORTY PERCENT OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS STUDY THOSE SUBJECTS EACH YEAR THE PANDEMIC CUT BY FORTY FIVE PERCENT THE NUMBER OF NEW INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS STUDYING IN THE U S THE REPORT INCLUDED STUDENTS TAKING CLASSES IN PERSON AND THOSE ATTENDING CLASSES BY VIDEO FROM HOME ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FEWER INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WORKED ON GRADUATE DEGREES DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR COMPARED TO THE YEAR BEFORE THE IIE REPORT SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ALREADY STUDYING IN THE U S DID NOT CHANGE VERY MUCH DROPPING JUST THREE PERCENT THE RECENT REPORT WAS NOT AS WORRYING AS SOME PEOPLE EXPECTED BASED ON THE INCREASE IN CORONAVIRUS INFECTIONS OVER THE SUMMER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED THAT A SLOWDOWN IN VISA PROCESSING VACCINATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WERE THE REASONS FOR THE LOWER NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLE VINH LE IS A STUDENT FROM VIETNAM STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HE ONLY MADE IT TO CALIFORNIA ON NOVEMBER FIRST BECAUSE OF TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AT HOME HE WAS NOT ABLE TO GET VACCINATED AND TO HO CHI MINH CITY FOR A FLIGHT TO THE U S INSTEAD HE TOOK CLASSES BY COMPUTER FROM HOME FOR TWO MONTHS HE SAID HIS PROFESSORS WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND HELPED HIM BY RECORDING CLASSES

THE DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WAS PENT UP LUSSENHOP FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAID THE U S EXPECTS THE INCREASE IN STUDENT INTEREST TO CONTINUE BECAUSE STUDENTS CONTINUE TO VALUE A U S EDUCATION SOME PEOPLE GIVE CREDIT TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN FOR SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS IN JULY U S OFFICIALS INCLUDING SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN AND EDUCATION SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA RECORDED VIDEO MESSAGES THAT WELCOMED INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS TO THE U S RACHEL BANKS IS DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE PLANNING FOR NAFSA AN ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION BASED IN WASHINGTON SHE SAID THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IS TELLING THE WORLD INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE U S EXPERTS ARE WORRIED HOWEVER THAT THE INCREASE IN STUDENTS WILL ONLY HELP SCHOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY POPULAR THEY THINK SMALLER SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES MAY NOT RECOVER ACROSS THE U S THE TWO YEAR SCHOOLS SUFFERED A TWENTY FOUR PERCENT LOSS OF
