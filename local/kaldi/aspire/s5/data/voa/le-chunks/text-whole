voa-005da417-c2ad-48f4-a08c-c0800f79d33c2 WHEN CAMBODIA FIRST BEGAN OFFERING COVID NINETEEN VACCINATIONS PEOPLE WAITED IN LONG LINES BUT THREE MONTHS INTO ITS CAMPAIGN JUST ELEVEN PERCENT OF CAMBODIA'S POPULATION HAD RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE VACCINE DOSE IN JAPAN IT TOOK TWO WEEKS LONGER TO REACH THAT LEVEL NOW BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE VACCINATION RATES THAT ARE AMONG THE WORLD'S BEST THE ASIAN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH RATES INCLUDE RICH AND POOR NATIONS SOME ARE BIG AND SOME ARE SMALL BUT ALL HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASES THE VIRAL DISEASE RELATED TO COVID NINETEEN SARS CAUSED AN OUTBREAK IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THE ASIAN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH VACCINATION RATES ALSO CHOSE TO ORDER VACCINES FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS MOST OF THE HIGHLY VACCINATED ASIAN COUNTRIES STARTED OFFERING SHOTS LATER THAN OTHER PLACES INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES BY THE TIME THE NATIONS STARTED INJECTING THEIR CITIZENS COUNTRIES LIKE THE U S BRITAIN AND INDIA WERE REPORTING RISING NUMBERS OF DEATHS THAT HELPED TO GET PEOPLE WHO HAD DOUBTS TO GET VACCINATED I DID WORRY BUT AT THE MOMENT WE ARE LIVING UNDER THE THREAT OF COVID NINETEEN THERE IS NO OPTION BUT TO BE VACCINATED SAID RATH SREYMOM A CAMBODIAN MOTHER SHE TOOK HER FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER NUTH NYRA TO GET A SHOT ONCE CAMBODIA OPENED ITS PROGRAM TO HER AGE GROUP CAMBODIA WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER COUNTRIES IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA TO START ITS VACCINATION PROGRAM IT LAUNCHED ITS EFFORT ON FEBRUARY TENTH THAT WAS STILL TWO MONTHS AFTER THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN BEGAN THEIRS THE EFFORT BEGAN SLOWLY BY EARLY MAY THE DELTA VARIANT A NEW VERSION OF THE VIRUS WAS SPREADING QUICKLY AROUND THE WORLD AT THE TIME JUST ELEVEN PERCENT OF CAMBODIA'S SIXTEEN MILLION PEOPLE HAD GOTTEN THEIR FIRST SHOT OUR WORLD IN DATA REPORTED DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE UNITED STATES OFFERING VACCINES ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAD GOTTEN THEIR FIRST SHOT BUT TODAY CAMBODIA IS SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT FULLY VACCINATED COMPARED TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT IN THE UNITED STATES CAMBODIA IS NOW OFFERING BOOSTER SHOTS IT IS CONSIDERING EXTENDING ITS PROGRAM TO CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS THREE FROM THE BEGINNING CAMBODIA HAS SEEN STRONG DEMAND FOR THE VACCINE PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN USED HIS CLOSE TIES WITH CHINA TO ORDER NEARLY THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOSES FROM CHINA SOME OF WHICH WERE DONATED CAMBODIA ALSO RECEIVED LARGE DONATIONS FROM THE U S JAPAN BRITAIN AND FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COVAX PROGRAM STILL IT TOOK TIME TO GET ENOUGH SUPPLIES MANY OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES THAT STARTED THEIR PROGRAMS LATER STRUGGLED EVEN MORE THE PROBLEMS INCREASED WHEN INDIA THE REGION'S MAJOR VACCINE PRODUCER SUSPENDED VACCINE EXPORTS MANY ASIAN COUNTRIES PUT IN PLACE EXTREME STAY AT HOME MEASURES AND TRAVEL RULES THAT KEPT THE VIRUS NUMBERS LOW BUT WHEN THE DELTA VARIANT BEGAN SPREADING THROUGH THE REGION CASES ROSE QUICKLY AND PEOPLE SIGNED UP TO GET VACCINATED MALAYSIA MADE EXTRA EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL GROUPS WERE OFFERED THE VACCINE WITH THE HELP OF THE RED CROSS IT GAVE SHOTS TO PEOPLE LIVING IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND OTHER GROUPS THAT MAY HAVE FEARED SHOWING UP FOR A GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED VACCINATION WE MADE THE VACCINE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED SAID SAZALY ABU BAKAR HE IS DIRECTOR OF THE TROPICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND RESEARCH EDUCATION CENTER IN MALAYSIA MALAYSIA STARTED SLOWLY IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS IT GAVE LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF ITS THIRTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE THEIR FIRST DOSE THEN CASE NUMBERS STARTED RISING MALAYSIA ACTED BY BUYING MORE DOSES AND ESTABLISHING HUNDREDS OF VACCINATION CENTERS IT SET UP CENTERS ABLE TO PROVIDE UP TO TEN THOUSAND SHOTS IN ONE DAY TODAY SEVENTY SIX PERCENT OF MALAYSIA'S POPULATION IS FULLY VACCINATED MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA ALSO HAVE VACCINATION RATES CLOSE TO OR ABOVE SEVENTY PERCENT THEY INCLUDE AUSTRALIA CHINA JAPAN AND BHUTAN IN SINGAPORE NINETY TWO PERCENT ARE FULLY VACCINATED SOME COUNTRIES IN ASIA HOWEVER HAVE CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE INDIA CELEBRATED GIVING ITS BILLIONTH COVID NINETEEN VACCINE DOSE IN OCTOBER BUT THE COUNTRY HAS OVER ONE POINT FOUR BILLION PEOPLE WITH TWO DOSES NEEDED THAT MEANS ONLY TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS FULLY VACCINATED INDONESIA STARTED OFFERING VACCINES EARLIER THAN MANY OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES BUT IT HAS ALSO STRUGGLED ITS DIFFICULTIES MOSTLY COME FROM EXPANDING ITS CAMPAIGN ACROSS THE THOUSANDS OF ISLANDS THAT MAKE UP THE COUNTRY JAPAN'S VACCINE PROGRAM WAS ESPECIALLY SLOW IN ITS EARLY MONTHS MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WONDERED HOW IT WOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD THE SUMMER OLYMPICS WHICH OPENED IN JULY JAPAN DID NOT START OFFERING VACCINES UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY BECAUSE IT REQUIRED ADDITIONAL TESTING ON JAPANESE PEOPLE THE MOVE WAS WIDELY CRITICIZED AS UNNECESSARY BUT THEN IT STARTED MAKING PROGRESS THEN PRIME MINISTER YOSHIHIDE SUGA BROUGHT IN MILITARY MEDICAL WORKERS TO OPERATE BIG VACCINATION CENTERS IN TOKYO AND OSAKA IT EASED LAWS TO LET DENTISTS EMERGENCY WORKERS AND LABORATORY WORKERS GIVE SHOTS IN ADDITION TO DOCTORS AND NURSES JAPAN IS NOW ABOUT SEVENTY SIX PERCENT FULLY VACCINATED MANY IN JAPAN EXPRESS DOUBT ABOUT VACCINES IN GENERAL BUT AFTER DEATH NUMBERS ROSE SHARPLY AROUND THE WORLD MANY PUT THEIR DOUBTS ASIDE RETIREE KIYOSHI GOTO IS ALREADY SEEKING A BOOSTER SHOT I WANT TO GET A BOOSTER SHOT AS OUR ANTIBODY LEVELS ARE GOING DOWN THE SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD SAID AND IN PHNOM PENH NUTH NYRA WAS HAPPY THE FIVE YEAR OLD SAID SHE WAS FEARFUL OF COVID NINETEEN BEFORE BUT NOT ANYMORE I FELT A LITTLE BIT OF PAIN WHEN I

voa-02fb06ba-d57f-4ab4-ace2-37b4bced855f3 THE COLLEGE YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE A TIME FOR STUDENTS TO EXPERIMENT MANY U S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES URGE THEIR STUDENTS TO EXPLORE A VARIETY OF IDEAS INTERESTS AND EVEN WAYS OF THINKING THAT MAY BE DIFFERENT OR NEW TO THEM MOST AMERICANS WHO GO TO COLLEGE USUALLY DO SO RIGHT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THEY ARE AWAY FROM HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME JOHN SCHULENBERG BELIEVES THAT BECAUSE OF THIS SEPARATION FROM FAMILY MEMBERS SOME OF THE EXPERIMENTATION DONE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES IS NOT HEALTHY SCHULENBERG IS A RESEARCH PROFESSOR AT THE INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HE NOTES THAT FOR YEARS DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE BY STUDENTS HAS BEEN A BIG ISSUE AT U S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MANY MOVIES AND TELEVISION SHOWS PRESENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE AS JUST A NORMAL PART OF THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE YET SCHULENBERG TOLD VOA THAT IT HAS A LASTING EFFECT ON STUDENTS' OVERALL WELL BEING THE FACT IS THE BRAIN IS STILL GROWING THROUGH THE MID TWENTIES HE SAID THAT IS WHY SCHULENBERG IS CONCERNED ABOUT EVIDENCE OF INCREASING USE OF THE DRUG MARIJUANA AT U S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN JULY HE AND A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS PUBLISHED A STUDY IT FOUND THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN MARIJUANA USE AMONG COLLEGE AGED AMERICANS REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE RESEARCHERS EXAMINED THE BEHAVIOR OF ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY TWO AFTER THEIR FINAL YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL ALMOST ONE THOUSAND OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN WERE ADMITTED TO A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY WHILE THE REST WERE NOT THE STUDY FOUND THAT ABOUT FORTY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE QUESTIONED REPORTED USING MARIJUANA SOMETIME DURING THE PAST YEAR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT REPORTED USING IT SOMETIME WITHIN THE PAST MONTH EARLIER RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED LINKS BETWEEN HEAVY MARIJUANA USE AND POOR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT SCHULENBERG WORRIES MORE ABOUT ANOTHER FINDING OF THE NEW STUDY IT SHOWS THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE VAPING MARIJUANA DOUBLED BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY USE AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE SUCH AS AN E CIGARETTE TO COMBINE WATER VAPOR WITH MARIJUANA THE VAPOR CONTAINS TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL OR THC A CHEMICAL FOUND NATURALLY IN THE CANNABIS PLANT SCHULENBERG SAYS HE HAS NEVER BEFORE SEEN ANY FORM OF DRUG USE DOUBLE IN JUST ONE YEAR THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTS THAT VAPING HAS BEEN TIED TO NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED CASES OF LUNG DISEASE AND AT LEAST FOURTEEN DEATHS NATIONWIDE THE NEWSPAPER ALSO REPORTED THAT POLICE HAVE ARRESTED PRODUCERS OF THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL THC VAPING DEVICES IN THREE STATES DELYNNE WILCOX SAYS THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY BOTH MARIJUANA USE IN GENERAL AND VAPING ARE ON THE RISE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE SHE IS CO CHAIR OF THE ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND OTHER DRUGS COALITION FOR THE AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH ASSOCIATION FOR ONE THING SHE SAYS A GROWING NUMBER OF STATES HAVE EASED THEIR RULES BANNING MARIJUANA USE THIS HAS RESULTED IN PART FROM EFFORTS OF THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY TO SPREAD THE BELIEF THAT THE DRUG HAS MEDICAL USES THE IMMEDIATE INTOXICATING EFFECT OF ALCOHOL AS WELL AS THE DANGERS OF ITS OVERUSE ARE ALSO CLEARER THAN THAT OF MARIJUANA WILCOX SAYS SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT USING MARIJUANA IS SAFER THAN DRINKING BEER OR OTHER FORMS OF ALCOHOL SCHULENBERG AGREES THAT MORE PEOPLE SEE MARIJUANA AS SAFE TO USE HE NOTED THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONLY TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWO YEAR OLDS SAID USING MARIJUANA CAN BE HARMFUL EITHER PHYSICALLY OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE FELT THAT WAY AND SOME RESEARCHERS ARE LOOKING AT WAYS IN WHICH MARIJUANA MAY HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON OTHER MORE DANGEROUS DRUGS HOWEVER BOTH SCHULENBERG AND WILCOX AGREE THAT THE SCIENCE SUPPORTING THESE CLAIMS IS LACKING AS MARIJUANA REMAINS ILLEGAL ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL SO THE STUDY OF BOTH ITS POSSIBLE HELPFUL AND HARMFUL QUALITIES IS GREATLY LIMITED WILCOX ADDS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF VAPING FOR THE SAME REASONS THEY ARE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT MARIJUANA SOME COMPANIES HAVE ADVERTISED VAPORIZED NICOTINE PRODUCTS AS A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE TO SMOKING TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES THEY ALSO OFFER PRODUCTS THAT TASTE LIKE FRUIT OR CREATE A PLEASANT SMELL BUT WILCOX ARGUES THERE IS HOPE FOR THE FIGHT TO REDUCE THESE UNHEALTHY BEHAVIORS AT U S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SHE SAYS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SCHOOL POLICIES BARRING USE OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND WHEN IT COMES TO ALCOHOL HEAVY DRINKING AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS HAS BEEN DECREASING IN RECENT YEARS SO THERE ARE SIGNS STUDENTS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN HEALTHY LIVING SCHOOL OFFICIALS NEED TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ENFORCEMENT OF RULES GOVERNING MARIJUANA AND OTHER SUBSTANCES SAYS WILCOX THEY SHOULD ALSO SEEK WAYS TO LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH DRUGS EVEN IF THEY ARE LEGAL IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY SUPPORTING HEALTHY BEHAVIOR IS ALSO IMPORTANT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SHOULD OFFER MORE NON ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES THAT ARE SUBSTANCE FREE THE SAME GOES FOR CREATING SYSTEMS THAT CAN IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE AT RISK OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OFFERING TO HELP THEM THE LONGER WE CAN DELAY THE USE THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE AS A SOCIETY SAID WILCOX I'M Â­KELLY JEAN KELLY AND I'M PETE MUSTO

INFORMATION COMES FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER A DEGREE FROM A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE TO BE AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD A GOOD JOB EMPLOYERS HAVE USED THE CREDENTIAL TO HELP CHOOSE BETWEEN JOB CANDIDATES EXPERTS WHO STUDY LABOR AND HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE SAID A COLLEGE DEGREE TELLS BUSINESSES THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE BASIC WORK SKILLS BUT BY TWENTY NINETEEN THE NUMBER OF ADULTS WITH COLLEGE DEGREES INCREASED TO THIRTY SIX PERCENT THAT IS A RISE OF EIGHTY PERCENT OVER THIRTY YEARS A TWENTY NINETEEN STORY IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL NEWSPAPER CALLED THIS INCREASE DEGREE INFLATION THAT MEANT THE CREDENTIAL HAD BECOME LESS VALUABLE BECAUSE IT WAS SO COMMON HOWEVER MANY BUSINESSES STILL USE A COLLEGE DEGREE AS A FILTER IN CHOOSING POSSIBLE WORKERS WHILE MORE AMERICAN WORKERS HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE THAN IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THERE ARE STILL MILLIONS OF EXPERIENCED WORKERS WHO DO NOT HAVE ONE PEOPLE WHO STUDY LABOR SAY DEPENDENCE ON A COLLEGE DEGREE CREATES A NEEDLESS BARRIER BYRON AUGUSTE IS ONE OF THEM AUGUSTE IS AN ECONOMIST AND A LABOR EXPERT HE WAS AN ADVISER TO FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA IN TWENTY FIFTEEN HE HELPED START A COMPANY CALLED

WROTE AN OPINION PIECE FOR THE WASHINGTON POST NEWSPAPER HE LATER SPOKE ABOUT HIS WORK IN A PODCAST HE SAID THE COLLEGE DEGREE FILTER CREATES A SKILLS GAP THE LACK OF A DEGREE MAKES EMPLOYERS THINK THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH WORKERS TO DO SOME JOBS BUT IN FACT THERE ARE WORKERS WITH THE NEEDED SKILLS MOST OF THE SKILLS WE USE AT WORK WE LEARN ON THE JOB NOT IN SCHOOL SO IF WE STOP PEOPLE FROM HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE ON THE JOB WELL THEN OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO WORK OUR WAY INTO A SKILLS GAP AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE SOME JOBS CLEARLY REQUIRE SPECIAL DEGREES AND TRAINING SUCH AS THE PROFESSIONS OF MEDICINE OR LAW HOWEVER THERE ARE MILLIONS OF GOOD WORKERS IN THE U S WHO HAVE VALUABLE EXPERIENCE SAID CRISTIAN SIRERA HE WORKS WITH AUGUSTE AT OPPORTUNITY AT WORK SIRERA SAID THEY MAY HAVE JOBS AT LARGE STORES LIKE WALMART AND COULD MOVE INTO BETTER JOBS WITH A LITTLE SPECIAL TRAINING SIRERA SAID MANY OF THESE PEOPLE SPEAK ENGLISH AND ANOTHER LANGUAGE HE GAVE AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN SPEAK BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH HE SAID AN IMMIGRANT HAS SKILLS PEOPLE CANNOT LEARN IN COLLEGE LIKE PATIENCE AND NOT TAKING THINGS TOO PERSONALLY AND

IDENTIFY A GOOD WORKER AND THEN TRAIN THEM FOR A BETTER JOB AUGUSTE RECENTLY SPOKE WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES NEWSPAPER HE SAID PEOPLE NEED DEPENDABLE JOBS TO ENTER THE MIDDLE CLASS IF COMPANIES CONTINUE FOUR YEAR DEGREE REQUIREMENTS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET BETTER JOBS SIRERA MOVED TO THE U S FROM SPAIN WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE HE FOUND THAT IF HE WANTED TO HAVE A GOOD JOB HE WOULD NEED TO FIND A WAY TO FINISH COLLEGE HE DID THAT BUT IT WAS NOT EASY HE STARTED BY ATTENDING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE MANY PEOPLE WILL STILL NEED TO PUSH THEMSELVES TO GET A COLLEGE DEGREE HE SAID HOWEVER COMPANIES LIKE OPPORTUNITY AT WORK ARE ASKING BUSINESSES TO RECONSIDER THEIR JOB REQUIREMENTS A RECENT STORY BY THE HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW NOTED THAT DURING THE COVID NINETEEN HEALTH CRISIS SOME COMPANIES REMOVED A COLLEGE DEGREE FROM THEIR LIST OF JOB REQUIREMENTS BEFORE THAT A TWENTY EIGHTEEN STORY BY CNBC NOTED THAT COMPANIES INCLUDING GOOGLE APPLE IBM AND STARBUCKS WERE REMOVING COLLEGE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS FROM SOME JOB LISTINGS SIRERA SAID MANY OF THOSE JOBS ARE SHOW YOUR WORK JOBS LIKE WRITING PROGRAMMING FOR COMPUTERS BUT HE SAID THERE ARE STILL OTHER JOBS WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORK EXPERIENCE WITHOUT A DEGREE CAN SUCCEED ALSO HE SAID COMPANIES NEED TO TELL THEIR EMPLOYEES ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO GET BETTER JOBS AND TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR GOOD WORKERS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THEM SIRERA CALLED ON EMPLOYERS TO OFFER JOBS WITH MID LEVEL PAY AND GOOD JOB POSSIBILITIES TO STARS HE SAID THAT STARS ANSWER WHEN EMPLOYERS SEND A STRONG SIGNAL THAT THEY NEED WORKERS WITH SKILLS AND DO NOT REQUIRE A COLLEGE DEGREE BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW EMPLOYERS ARE FAILING TO TURN THE SIGNAL ON AND COMMIT TO ACTION THAT HE ADDED PREVENTS STARS FROM TAKING ACTION AND KEEPS THEM ON THE

TWENTY TWENTY EDUCATION WENT ONLINE AND DISTANCE LEARNING HAS CONTINUED SINCE TEACHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY QUICKLY FOUND THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TEACH AS MUCH MATERIAL AS USUAL TO THEIR STUDENTS THE EDUCATORS HAD TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT WHAT CONTENT TO COVER AND WHAT COULD BE DROPPED SO OVER TIME ENGLISH TEACHERS BEGAN CUTTING SOME BOOKS AND WRITING PROJECTS FROM THEIR TEACHING PLANS HISTORY TEACHERS BEGAN TO SHRINK THEIR COVERAGE OF SOME PERIODS SCIENCE TEACHERS HAD TO REMOVE EXPERIMENT BASED WORK BECAUSE SCHOOL LABORATORIES WERE NO LONGER AVAILABLE WHILE SOME STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THEIR STUDIES WHILE WORKING FROM HOME MANY STRUGGLED WITHOUT BEING AT SCHOOL IN THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR MANY TEACHERS HAVE NOT EVEN MET THEIR STUDENTS IN PERSON ALISON REEVES IS A SPANISH TEACHER AT A HIGH SCHOOL IN FAIRFAX VIRGINIA ABOUT THIRTY KILOMETERS OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON D C SHE SAID BY THIS TIME IN A SCHOOL YEAR SHE USUALLY KNOWS HER STUDENTS WELL BUT THIS YEAR IS DIFFERENT I HAVE GOTTEN A GOOD SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE BUT YOU LEARN DIFFERENT THINGS VIRTUALLY I KNOW THEIR VOICES WHEN THEY ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR FACE LOOKS LIKE PER SE SHE SAID DISTANCE LEARNING IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS IN LANGUAGE CLASSES AT THE START OF A NORMAL SCHOOL YEAR SHE EXPLAINED SOME STUDENTS CAN BE SHY ABOUT SAYING A WORD INCORRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEIR FRIENDS BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY UNDERSTAND EVERYONE IN THE CLASS IS LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE AT THAT POINT THEY ARE NOT SHY ANYMORE BUT AT HOME REEVES SAID THE STUDENTS ARE SHYER THEY WORRY ABOUT MAKING MISTAKES IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS BECAUSE OF THIS REEVES SAID SHE HAS MADE SPEAKING LESS OF A PRIORITY THIS YEAR THAN IN PAST YEARS SHE IS MORE CENTERED ON HELPING HER STUDENTS LEARN TO WRITE IN SPANISH IN ADDITION SHE USUALLY HAS HER STUDENTS LEARNING TWO DIFFERENT PAST TENSES BY NOW THIS YEAR SHE HAS CENTERED MORE ON THE PRESENT TENSE REEVES IS NOT THE ONLY TEACHER CHANGING HER TEACHING PLAN TASSIE ZAHNER TEACHES ADVANCED PLACEMENT U S HISTORY AT A HIGH SCHOOL IN SILVER SPRING MARYLAND ABOUT FIFTEEN KILOMETERS FROM WASHINGTON D C SHE HAS BEEN TEACHING FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR HER STUDENTS TAKE A NATIONAL HISTORY TEST COLLEGES USE THE SCORES TO HELP MAKE ADMISSIONS DECISIONS ZAHNER CUT HOW MUCH TIME SHE SPENDS ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF AMERICAN HISTORY FOR EXAMPLE SHE USUALLY SPENDS EIGHTEEN CLASS PERIODS TEACHING ABOUT THE LAST PART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT TAKES OVER THREE WEEKS THIS YEAR SHE DID IT IN FOUR HOURS AS A RESULT SHE THINKS SOME OF HER STUDENTS' TEST SCORES WILL NOT SHOW THEIR TRUE ABILITY ZAHNER SAID THE LEADERS OF HER SCHOOL ARE NOT THAT WORRIED ABOUT THE TEST SCORES THIS YEAR BUT HER STUDENTS ARE I HAVE STUDENTS WHO WANT THAT SCORE ON THE EXAM THEY DO CARE VERY MUCH AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GIVE THEM THE SAME KIND OF INFORMATION AND THE SAME RIGOR THAT WE DO IN THE REAL CLASSROOM HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME AND FOR THEM JAKE STANFORD TEACHES ENGLISH AT PALM SPRINGS HIGH SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA HE HAS BEEN TEACHING FOR THIRTEEN YEARS HIS SCHOOL CHANGED ITS SCHEDULE BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC THAT GREATLY AFFECTED WRITING PROJECTS HE WOULD NORMALLY GIVE HIS STUDENTS THE WRITING PROJECTS REQUIRE A LOT OF TIME STUDENTS WRITE AND REWRITE A PAPER SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THEY ARE FINISHED STANFORD SAID HE NORMALLY ASKS STUDENTS TO WRITE TWENTY FOUR PAPERS OVER THE YEAR BUT NOT THIS YEAR IT'S JUST NOT BEEN REALISTIC TO TRY TO EXPECT THAT AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM COLLEAGUES AS WELL STANFORD SAID HIS STUDENTS WILL DO HALF THE USUAL NUMBER OF WRITING PROJECTS CRISTIN ESPINOZA TEACHES ENGLISH IN DENVER COLORADO SHE SAID SHE HAD TO REMOVE SOME OF HER FAVORITE PROJECTS FROM HER TEACHING PLAN THIS YEAR CLASS TIME USED TO BE NINETY MINUTES LONG SHE SAID NOW SHE SEES HER STUDENTS FOR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES EACH CLASS SOME TEACHERS HOWEVER ARE ALSO REPORTING EDUCATIONAL SUCCESSES WITHIN THE NEW STRUCTURE JAKE STANFORD SAID SOME OF HIS STUDENTS ARE PERFORMING BETTER THAN IN THE PAST DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS HEALTH CRISIS THEY DON'T HAVE AS MANY OTHER THINGS GOING ON THEY ARE ABSORBING MATERIAL AND GAINING A HIGHER LEVEL OF SKILL VERY VERY QUICKLY ALISON REEVES SAID SHE HOPES COLLEGES WILL CONSIDER THE PANDEMIC'S EFFECTS ON HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION WHEN THEY MAKE ADMISSIONS DECISIONS SHE IS HOPEFUL ABOUT THE FUTURE FOR STUDENTS OVERALL EVEN WITH LESS TEACHING TIME AND SUBJECT COVERAGE THEY ARE LEARNING HOW TO DEAL WITH DIFFICULT EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS THAT TRULY SHE SAID WILL TAKE YOU MUCH FURTHER THAN A LOT OF THE CONTENT TASSIE ZAHNER EXPRESSED SIMILAR THINKING WE HAVE STUDENTS AT MY SCHOOL THAT ARE WORKING AND HELPING SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND TAKING CARE OF MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSEHOLDS AND STILL SHOWING UP EVERY DAY AND GOING TO CLASS AND DOING THEIR WORK THAT'S IMPRESSIVE I'M DAN FRIEDELL DAN FRIEDELL WROTE THIS STORY FOR LEARNING

voa-06756f69-21cf-4579-b171-fb7776bbbf993 A RECENT STORY IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL NEWSPAPER LOOKED AT STUDENTS WHO WENT TO CELEBRATED UNIVERSITIES SUCH AS COLUMBIA AND NEW YORK UNIVERSITY IN NEW YORK CITY FOR ADVANCED DEGREES IN SUBJECTS LIKE ART FILM AND EVEN SOCIAL WORK MANY OF THE STUDENTS SAID THEY LEARNED A LOT HOWEVER WHEN THEY GRADUATED THEY WERE DEEP IN DEBT AND DID NOT THINK THEY WOULD FIND WORK THAT WOULD LET THEM PAY BACK THEIR LOANS AFTER GRADUATION MANY STUDENTS REPORTED OWING OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS MEANWHILE THEY WERE EARNING JUST FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ONE STUDENT WHO RECEIVED A MASTER OF FINE ARTS KNOWN AS AN MFA FROM COLUMBIA MATT BLACK TOLD THE NEWSPAPER HE WAS FINANCIALLY HOBBLED FOR LIFE AND OWED LENDERS CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS STUDENTS SAID THEY SPOKE WITH COLUMBIA ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF ADVANCED ARTS DEGREES BUT NEVER RECEIVED A REASONABLE ANSWER THE NEWSPAPER REPORTED EDUCATION EXPERTS SAY THESE SCHOOLS ARE VERY WEALTHY WITH LARGE ENDOWMENTS WHICH COULD BE USED TO PAY STUDENTS' TUITION THE UNIVERSITIES HOWEVER PREFER TO ASK THE STUDENTS TO PAY THE FULL COST ONE FAMOUS SCHOOL YALE IS CHANGING THE SYSTEM ITS THEATER PROGRAM WILL BE FREE TO STUDENTS AFTER A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS DONATION FROM MUSIC AND MOVIE PRODUCER DAVID GEFFEN THE DATA FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL STORY CAME FROM THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND IT WAS RESTRICTED TO THE TWO YEARS AFTER A STUDENT GRADUATED WHEN REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UNIVERSITIES IN THE STORY WERE ASKED ABOUT THEIR GRADUATES' FINANCIAL PROBLEMS MANY SAID TWO YEARS IS A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THEY SAID THEIR GRADUATES SLOWLY INCREASE THEIR EARNINGS OVER TIME IN SUBJECTS LIKE MATH MEDICINE SCIENCE AND COMPUTER PROGRAMMING ADVANCED DEGREES ARE OFTEN REQUIRED FOR FIRST YEAR JOBS HOWEVER IN MORE CREATIVE CAREERS LIKE WRITING MAKING MOVIES OR PAINTING PEOPLE CAN BE VERY SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT GETTING AN ADVANCED DEGREE KEVIN CAREY IS A HIGHER EDUCATION EXPERT FOR NEW AMERICA A PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH CENTER HE CALLED MASTER'S DEGREES A SCAM IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE WEBSITE SLATE DOT COM CHARGING PEOPLE A TON OF MONEY TO GO INTO ANY ARTISTIC CAREER IS OFTEN SUPER PROBLEMATIC HE SAID CAREY ALSO SAID SCHOOLS SAY WE NEED THE MONEY WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF THEIR MASTER'S DEGREES BUT EVERYONE NEEDS MONEY HE SAID ADDING IT IS A POOR DEFENSE EVEN IN CAREERS LIKE LAW OR BUSINESS ADVANCED DEGREES ARE NO GUARANTEE OF FINANCIAL SUCCESS THE SAME WALL STREET JOURNAL WRITERS LOOKED AT LAW SCHOOL GRADUATES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI IN FLORIDA THEY SAW RECENT GRADUATES OFTEN BORROWED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL TWO YEARS AFTER GRADUATION THEY WERE EARNING JUST FIFTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS SERGIO CASTILLO IS AN ACTOR IN NEW YORK CITY HE SAID HE OWES SO MUCH MONEY ON HIS STUDENT LOANS THAT HE NO LONGER PAYS THEM HE WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES AND THEN EARNED AN MFA FROM THE ACTORS STUDIO IN NEW YORK CITY HE DOES NOT EXPECT TO EARN A LOT OF MONEY FROM ACTING WAS HIS MFA WORTH THE COST I DO THINK IT WAS WORTH IT I DON'T PUT A PRICE TAG ON MY EDUCATION OR MY EXPERIENCE I THINK IT'S SORT OF UNFORTUNATE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE TAKE FOR GRANTED EDUCATION SO MANY PEOPLE PEOPLE LIKE MY MOTHER FOR EXAMPLE NEVER GOT TO GO TO COLLEGE CASTILLO SAID STUDENTS WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT AN ADVANCED DEGREE IN ART SHOULD BE SURE THEY ARE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY VALUE THE EDUCATION NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT MONEY OR TO BE FAMOUS THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO DON'T GO INTO IT FOR THAT REASON LYNNE ADRINE IS A FORMER TELEVISION PRODUCER WHO RUNS THE BROADCAST JOURNALISM GRADUATE PROGRAM IN WASHINGTON D C FOR SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY SHE SAID STUDENTS MUST ASK AN IMPORTANT QUESTION WHEN THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT GRADUATE SCHOOL IS IT WORTH THE INVESTMENT OF ALL THAT MONEY FOR THAT MASTER'S DEGREE AND WHAT IS IT GOING TO TURN INTO LATER IN SOME FIELDS PEOPLE MAY HAVE BETTER EXPERIENCES WORKING AS AN ASSISTANT THAN SPENDING MONEY ON GRADUATE SCHOOL ADRINE WARNED THAT THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE U S IS A SERIOUS ISSUE I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A RECKONING COMING IN TERMS OF COLLEGE TUITION IN GENERAL AND THE BANG FOR THE BUCK THAT ONE GETS SHE SAID KASIA PLAZINSKA IS A FILMMAKER IN NEW YORK CITY SHE CAME TO THE U S FROM POLAND TO STUDY ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO SHE ATTENDED GRADUATE SCHOOL BOTH AT BAYLOR UNIVERSITY IN TEXAS AND AT THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA SHE SAID SHE RECEIVED A LOT OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THOSE UNIVERSITIES WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF GRADUATE SCHOOL IN THE U S SHE DESCRIBED IT WITH ONE WORD INSANITY IT IS SO INSANE I MEAN I KNOW FRIENDS WHO ARE STUCK WITH THE DEBT AND LITERALLY THEY CAN'T THEY ARE NOT TAKING RISKS IN LIFE JUST EVEN CHANGING THE JOB BECAUSE THEY ARE SO AFRAID PLAZINSKA SAID ARTS GRADUATE PROGRAMS CAN HELP STUDENTS MEET AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH FELLOW ARTISTS WITH WHOM THEY CAN WORK THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREERS IT'S EVEN BETTER IF THE SCHOOL IS IN A PLACE LIKE NEW YORK OR LOS ANGELES THOSE INTERVIEWED DID NOT HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF COSTLY ADVANCED DEGREES IN CREATIVE SUBJECTS FOR SCHOOL TO BE OF VALUE PLAZINSKA SAID STUDENTS NEED TO REMEMBER WHY THEY STARTED MAKING ART IN THE BEGINNING IT'S FOR JUST FOR THE PURE PLEASURE OF CREATING AND FULFILLING MYSELF THIS WAY I'M DAN FRIEDELL

voa-0814e0f8-c383-436b-8f44-d2178873a2933 MORE COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE TURNING TO THEIR SCHOOLS FOR HELP WITH ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS OR AP REPORTS THAT MANY STUDENTS MUST WAIT WEEKS FOR TREATMENT OR FIND HELP OUTSIDE THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY AS SCHOOL CLINICS STRUGGLE TO MEET DEMAND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE FINDINGS FROM AN AP STUDY OF OVER THHIRTY PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE U S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS CHANGED LITTLE YET ON SOME CAMPUSES THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS SEEKING TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAS NEARLY DOUBLED THIS INCREASE HAS BEEN TIED TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH ISSUES ALONG WITH RISING RATES OF DEPRESSION AND OTHER DISORDERS UNIVERSITIES HAVE EXPANDED THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS BUT THAT GROWTH IS OFTEN SLOW AND DEMAND KEEPS RISING LONG WAITS HAVE LED TO PROTESTS AT SCHOOLS FROM MARYLAND TO CALIFORNIA IN SOME CASES FOLLOWING STUDENT SUICIDES IN ADDITION CAMPUS CLINICS INCREASINGLY REQUIRE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS TO DO MORE WORK HOWEVER THIS CAN LEAD TO TIRED BURNED OUT EMPLOYEES JAMIE DAVIDSON IS ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT FOR STUDENT WELLNESS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS HE TOLD THE AP HIS SCHOOL STRUGGLES WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WHO NEED MENTAL HEALTH HELP THE UNIVERSITY HAS ELEVEN TRAINED COUNSELORS FOR THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS BUT HER TEAM STILL FINDS THE WORK DIFFICULT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO TALK TO ANYONE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH FIELD WHO TELLS YOU WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES DAVIDSON SAID THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REQUESTED FIVE YEARS OF RECORDS FROM THE LARGEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN ALL FIFTY STATES A TOTAL OF THIRTY NINE PROVIDED YEAR BY YEAR DATA FROM THEIR COUNSELING CLINICS OR HEALTH CENTERS THE RECORDS SHOW THAT MOST UNIVERSITIES ARE WORKING TO EXPAND THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT MANY ARE SIMPLY UNABLE TO MEET DEMAND SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS RECEIVING TREATMENT AT THE UNIVERSITIES HAS GROWN BY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT YET THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS ATTENDING THOSE SCHOOLS ROSE JUST FIVE PERCENT BY LAST YEAR NEARLY ONE IN TEN STUDENTS WERE COMING FOR HELP BUT THE NUMBER OF TRAINED COUNSELORS CHANGED LITTLE THAT MEANS ONE COUNSELOR FOR EVERY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS ON SOME CAMPUSES INCLUDING AT UTAH VALLEY UNIVERSITY EXPERTS SUGGEST AT LEAST ONE MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS BUT FEW OF THE THIRTY NINE UNIVERSITIES MET THAT BENCHMARK WHEN ASHTYN AURE SOUGHT TREATMENT AT UTAH VALLEY'S CLINIC LAST YEAR SHE WAS SUFFERING ANXIETY ATTACKS AND HAD NOT SLEPT FOR DAYS HER MIND KEPT RETURNING TO PAINFUL EXPERIENCES FROM HER PAST WHEN SHE ASKED TO SEE A COUNSELOR ONE WORKER TOLD HER THE WAIT LIST STRETCHED FOR MONTHS SHE LEFT WITHOUT GETTING HELP THAT WAS THE PLACE I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER THAT DO YOU GO TO THE HOSPITAL DO YOU PHONE A FRIEND SAID AURE IN THE END SHE TURNED TO HER RELIGIOUS GROUP WHICH HELPED HER FIND THERAPY AT AN OFF CAMPUS CLINIC IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT SHE SAID I DON'T KNOW OFFICIALS AT UTAH VALLEY SAID THEY ARE WORKING TO AVOID SUCH CASES IF OFFICIALS KNOW A STUDENT IS HAVING SERIOUS PROBLEMS THEY SAID A COUNSELOR CAN SEE THAT PERSON IN A FEW MINUTES BUT WORKERS HAVE ONLY A BRIEF PERIOD TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT TREATMENT UNFORTUNATELY STORIES LIKE THIS ARE NOT UNCOMMON SAID WILLIAM ERB SENIOR DIRECTOR OF STUDENT HEALTH SERVICES AT UTAH VALLEY WE TRAIN REVIEW AND REVISE THESE PROCEDURES SO THAT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS CAN BE AVOIDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AT MOST UNIVERSITIES STUDENTS CONSIDERING SUICIDE OR FACING OTHER SERIOUS ISSUES ARE OFFERED HELP RIGHT AWAY OTHERS ARE ASKED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR CASES THAT ARE NOT URGENT THE WAIT CAN LAST FROM HOURS TO MONTHS DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF YEAR AND THE DESIGN OF THE CLINIC MANY SCHOOLS THAT PROVIDED DATA TO THE AP SAID IT TAKES WEEKS TO GET A FIRST APPOINTMENT AT UTAH VALLEY STUDENTS WAITED AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN FOUR WEEKS LAST YEAR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AT SEATTLE IT WAS THREE WEEKS DURING BUSY TIMES AT LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY WAIT TIMES STRETCHED TO FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS TO SOME STUDENTS WAITING IS JUST A MINOR PROBLEM BUT IT RAISES THE RISK THAT SOME YOUNG PEOPLE WILL GIVE UP ON SEEKING TREATMENT POSSIBLY LEADING TO A WORSENING OF THEIR CONDITION AT SEVERAL UNIVERSITIES STUDENTS HAVE ORGANIZED CAMPAIGNS TO IMPROVE COUNSELING SERVICES BUT FOR MENTAL HEALTH CASES THAT ARE NOT URGENT SOME ARGUE THAT WAITING IS NOT NECESSARILY BAD '' AND COULD EVEN LEAD TO BETTER RESULTS A RECENT STUDY FOUND GREATER REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AT CLINICS THAT PROVIDE STUDENTS ONGOING MEETINGS WITH COUNSELORS AS OPPOSED TO A SINGLE MEETING WHEN CONDITIONS WORSEN BUT UNDER THIS SYSTEM THE STUDENT MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT FOR A THERAPIST'S CASELOAD TO OPEN UP THE RISING DEMAND FOR CAMPUS MENTAL HEALTH CARE HAS BEEN LINKED TO MANY THINGS PUBLIC RECOGNITION OF THE ISSUE HAS IMPROVED LEADING MORE STUDENTS TO GET HELP DISORDERS THAT ONCE PREVENTED STUDENTS FROM GOING TO COLLEGE ARE NO LONGER SEEN AS A BARRIER SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE SOCIAL MEDIA FUELS ANXIETY WHILE OTHERS SAY THE CURRENT GENERATION OF STUDENTS SIMPLY HAS MORE TROUBLE DEALING WITH STRESS MANY UNIVERSITIES ARE NOW RETHINKING HOW THEY PROVIDE HELP SUCH AS OFFERING MORE SHORT TERM TREATMENT PROGRAMS MORE STUDENTS ARE BEING PUSHED TOWARDS GROUP THERAPY OR CLASSES ON DEALING WITH ANXIETY COUNSELING CENTERS OFFER ACTIVITIES LIKE YOGA AND MANY TRAIN STUDENTS TO PROVIDE EMOTIONAL HELP TO ONE ANOTHER RISING DEMAND HAS

GOING INTO MEDICAL RESEARCH IT WAS NOT JUST THAT SHE ENJOYED THE IDEA OF MAKING SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES THE TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD PENNSYLVANIA NATIVE SAYS HER PARENTS TAUGHT HER THE IMPORTANCE OF HELPING OTHERS SHE SAW MEDICAL RESEARCH AS A WAY OF HELPING IMPROVE SOCIETY AND SEEKING AN EDUCATION IN SUCH A FIELD WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO A HIGH PAYING JOB SO IN TWENTY THIRTEEN ROBERTS BEGAN STUDYING BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN WASHINGTON D C DURING HER FOUR YEARS THERE SHE VOLUNTEERED WITH YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE CITY SHE ALSO WORKED AS A TEACHING ASSISTANT FOR SEVERAL PROFESSORS THESE EXPERIENCES INTRODUCED HER TO OTHER MORE PERSONAL WAYS TO HELP PEOPLE AFTER COMPLETING HER STUDIES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ROBERTS TOOK A RESEARCH POSITION AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH BUT SHE SOON BEGAN FEELING DEEPLY UNHAPPY WITH HER WORK SHE WANTED A CHANGE WHAT MEANT MORE TO ME WAS A DAY TO DAY IMPACT THAT I COULD SEE AND THAT I COULD FEEL AND HAD MORE CONTROL OVER ROBERTS TOLD VOA SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ROBERTS TOOK A JOB DOING WHAT SHE HAD COME TO FIND MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE TEACHING SHE STARTED TEACHING SCIENCE CLASSES AT THE FUSION ACADEMY A PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL IN WASHINGTON D C THAT SERVES STUDENTS WITH NON TRADITIONAL NEEDS MANY OF ROBERTS' FORMER CLASSMATES AND COWORKERS NOW HAVE JOBS THAT PAY THEM MUCH MORE THAN SHE MAKES MANY OF THEM ALSO HAVE MORE FREE TIME THAN SHE DOES BUT ROBERTS SAYS SHE WOULD NOT TRADE MORE MONEY OR MORE FREE TIME FOR THE CREATIVITY AND PURPOSE SHE NOW FINDS IN HER WORK ROBERTS IS NOT ALONE IN FACT SEVERAL NEW STUDIES SHOW THAT COLLEGE GRADUATES IN THE U S ARE INCREASINGLY LOOKING FOR MORE THAN JUST GOOD PAY FROM THEIR JOBS EXPERTS SAY THIS MAY GREATLY CHANGE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES IN APRIL THE EMPLOYMENT WEBSITE INDEED RELEASED A STUDY ON THE JOB INTERESTS OF RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN OVER THE FOUR YEAR PERIOD THE LISTINGS THAT GAINED THE MOST INTEREST CHANGED FROM HIGHER PAYING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOBS TO ARTS AND SOCIAL SERVICES JOBS NICK BUNKER SUGGESTS THE REASON IS THE STRONG ECONOMY THE U S IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING HE IS AN ECONOMIST WITH INDEED'S HIRING LAB BUNKER ARGUES WITH HIGH DEMAND FROM EMPLOYERS AND LOW UNEMPLOYMENT GRADUATES ARE MORE LIKELY TO TURN TO CAREER FIELDS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE SEEM RISKIER TO THEM PEOPLE DO HAVE THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL VIEWS OF THE WORLD HE SAID AND IN A TIGHTER LABOR MARKET RECENT GRADUATES ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE OF AN ABILITY TO FIND JOBS THAT FIT WITH THOSE VIEWS ALSO IN APRIL THE RESEARCH ORGANIZATION GALLUP AND BATES COLLEGE IN MAINE PUBLISHED A JOINT STUDY ON CAREER INTERESTS OF U S COLLEGE GRADUATES THE RESEARCHERS ASKED MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED GRADUATES OF FOUR YEAR PROGRAMS WHAT THEY WANTED FROM THEIR JOBS THE PEOPLE THEY QUESTIONED WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY ONE AND FIFTY FIVE ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM SAID IT WAS EITHER VERY IMPORTANT OR EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO FEEL A SENSE OF PURPOSE FROM THEIR WORK WHAT IS A 'SENSE OF PURPOSE ' EXACTLY REBECCA FRASER THILL SAYS IT COMES FROM IDENTIFYING GOALS IN YOUR WORK THAT ARE BOTH MEANINGFUL TO YOU BUT THAT ALSO AFFECT THE REST OF THE WORLD FRASER THILL IS DIRECTOR OF FACULTY ENGAGEMENT AT THE BATES CENTER FOR PURPOSEFUL WORK FRASER THILL NOTES THAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT EVERY GENERATION REPRESENTED IN THE STUDY WANTED TO FIND A SENSE OF PURPOSE IN THEIR WORK OTHER GALLUP STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT TODAY'S YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN CALLED MILLENNIALS WANT IT EVEN MORE THAN EARLIER GENERATIONS IN THE PAST EMPLOYERS OFFERED GREATER JOB SECURITY THAN MOST JOBS TODAY FRASER THILL NOTES A PERSON WOULD OFTEN WORK FOR ONE COMPANY FOR MOST OF THEIR LIVES THAT COMPANY WOULD THEN OFFER THEM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ONCE THEY ENDED THEIR CAREERS SO EVEN IF WORKERS DID NOT FEEL AS MUCH OF A SENSE OF PURPOSE THEY AT LEAST FELT A MORE PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THEIR EMPLOYERS THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE SAID FRASER THILL ALL OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE GRADUATING NOW ARE GOING OUT INTO A WORLD WHERE THERE'RE GOING TO BE FEWER COMPANIES LOOKING OUT FOR THEM AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEY KNOW THAT THIS SENSE OF PURPOSE HAS TO COME FROM WITHIN SHE SAYS PEOPLE WITH JOBS THEY FIND MEANINGFUL ARE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE HEALTHIER MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY THIS IN TURN MAKES THEM BETTER WORKERS BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE KIND OF JOB A PERSON HAS THAT MAKES WORK SEEM PURPOSEFUL INSTEAD PURPOSE COMES FROM HOW AN EMPLOYEE RELATES TO THE DUTIES FOR WHICH THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE AN OFFICE WORKER MIGHT NOT FEEL AS THOUGH THEY ARE SAVING THE PLANET FOR EXAMPLE BUT FRASER THILL SAYS IF THEIR EMPLOYER TAKES THE TIME TO FIND WHAT AN EMPLOYEE'S INTERESTS ARE AND CENTERS THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ON THOSE INTERESTS WORKERS WILL HAVE A MORE PURPOSEFUL CONNECTION TO THEIR WORK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CAN HELP STUDENTS FIND WHAT GIVES THEM PURPOSE BEFORE THEY GRADUATE SHE ADDS THE SCHOOLS CAN DO SO BY HELPING THEM FIND INTERNSHIPS AND PROFESSORS CAN OFFER CLASSWORK THAT MAKES THEM THINK ABOUT THEIR CAREER GOALS AND HOLD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD REALLY EXPECT FROM THE WORKING WORLD I'M

voa-0c1f6f63-3615-4679-aa0f-742cea54cad33 HOW VALUABLE WOULD IT BE TO HAVE A GUARANTEED JOB FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES FEW JOBS COME WITH LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS FEDERAL JUDGES INCLUDING JUSTICES ON THE U S SUPREME COURT AND COLLEGE PROFESSORS ARE ON THE SHORT LIST PROFESSORS CAN EARN WHAT IS KNOWN AS TENURE THE IDEA OF TENURE GOT POPULAR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS AT SOME FAMOUS SCHOOLS DECIDED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO PROTECT PROFESSORS FROM OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE THE IDEA IS THAT A PROFESSOR WITH TENURE IS FREE TO TEACH OR DO RESEARCH EVEN IF THEIR STATE'S LEADER DOES NOT LIKE THE SUBJECT AS A RESULT IT IS RARE FOR A PROFESSOR WITH TENURE TO BE DISMISSED THOSE WHO ARGUE AGAINST TENURE SAY PROFESSORS MIGHT WORK HARD LEADING UP TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS A TENURE REVIEW AND THEN STOP WORKING AS HARD AFTER THEIR JOB IS SAFE IN ADDITION SOME EXPERTS WORRY THAT TENURE PROTECTS PROFESSORS WHO ARE ACCUSED OF BAD BEHAVIOR YOUNG PROFESSORS WHO ARE HIRED FOR JOBS WHERE TENURE IS A POSSIBILITY ARE SAID TO HAVE TENURE TRACK JOBS THEY OFTEN HAVE A REVIEW AFTER THEIR FIFTH YEAR IF THEY EARN TENURE THEN THEY HAVE A JOB THAT IS LARGELY GUARANTEED FOR AS LONG AS THEY WANT IT THE REVIEW IS EXTREMELY DETAILED PROFESSORS ARE JUDGED BY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY ON THE QUALITY OF THEIR TEACHING THE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THEY HAVE DONE IN THEIR SUBJECT AND BOOKS AND STUDIES THEY HAVE WRITTEN PROFESSORS AT OTHER SCHOOLS WRITE LETTERS AND PAST STUDENTS CAN ADD THEIR THOUGHTS THE IDEA OF TENURE HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS RECENTLY TWO WELL KNOWN BLACK PROFESSORS RECENTLY MADE PUBLIC DISPUTES THEY HAD WITH THE TENURE PROCESS AT SOME FAMOUS UNIVERSITIES CORNEL WEST IS A WELL KNOWN PROFESSOR WHO TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES AT HARVARD IN FEBRUARY HE SAID HARVARD REJECTED HIS REQUEST TO BE CONSIDERED FOR TENURE ALTHOUGH HE HAD A GOOD FIVE YEAR REVIEW WEST HAD A TENURED POSITION AT HARVARD IN THE PAST BUT LEFT THE SCHOOL IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AFTER A CONFLICT WITH THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT HE WENT ON TO TEACH AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY HE WENT BACK TO HARVARD IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WEST SAID HE WOULD LEAVE HARVARD TO TEACH AT THE UNION THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY IN NEW YORK CITY OVER THE SUMMER REPORTER NIKOLE HANNAH JONES ALSO WAS INVOLVED IN A DISPUTE OVER TENURE HANNAH JONES IS THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNING CREATOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES' SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT AND HAS RECEIVED THE FAMOUS MACARTHUR FOUNDATION GENIUS GRANT SHE WAS OFFERED A POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL THAT DID NOT INCLUDE TENURE PROFESSORS AT THE UNIVERSITY'S HUSSMAN SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM AND STUDENTS PROTESTED WIDESPREAD CRITICISM CAUSED THE UNIVERSITY TO RECONSIDER AND INCLUDE TENURE IN ITS OFFER HANNAH JONES REJECTED THE NEW OFFER AND DECIDED TO JOIN HOWARD UNIVERSITY IN WASHINGTON D C SHE WILL USE MONEY FROM OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS TO START A JOURNALISM CENTER THERE THE TENURE REVIEW IS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT IN A PROFESSOR'S CAREER YOUNG PROFESSORS OFTEN WORRY THEY WILL NOT DO ENOUGH TO GET TENURE AND THEY THEN WORRY THAT BEING DENIED TENURE WILL BE A BAD MARK ON THEIR RECORD ONE YOUNG PROFESSOR GERI KERSTIENS TEACHES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN SANTA CRUZ SHE SAID TWITTER IS FULL OF COMMENTS FROM PROFESSORS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR TENURE REVIEW BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF US AND NOT AS MANY JOBS BUT BEING DENIED TENURE CAN BE A NEW BEGINNING SOME PROFESSORS ARE REJECTED FOR TENURE BUT GO ON TO FIND A BETTER PLACE TO WORK ONE PROFESSOR FOUND A POSITION THAT OFFERED JOB SECURITY AND SUPPORTED HER BEST WORK ANNE BARANGER IS AN EXPERIENCED CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY HALF OF HER JOB IS TENURED AND HALF IS NOT HER STATUS SHE SAID IS UNUSUAL SHE SAID HER JOB IS SECURE BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE GETTING RID OF HALF A PERSON AND NOT THE OTHER HALF BEFORE MOVING TO CALIFORNIA SHE TAUGHT AT UNIVERSITIES IN ILLINOIS AND CONNECTICUT SHE NOW HELPS GRADUATE STUDENTS THINK ABOUT THEIR CAREER PATH MOST START TO PLAN THEIR CAREERS IN THEIR THIRD OR FOURTH YEAR AT THAT POINT THEY DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO BECOME A PROFESSOR OR WORK FOR A BUSINESS THAT HIRES CHEMISTS STUDENTS ALSO DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO CENTER THEIR CAREER ON TEACHING OR RESEARCH IN THE PAST UNIVERSITIES OFTEN GAVE EQUAL WEIGHT TO A NEW PROFESSOR'S ABILITY TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH TEACH AND SERVE THE UNIVERSITY IF A PROFESSOR WAS NOT GOOD IN ONE OF THOSE AREAS THEY WOULD BE DENIED TENURE NOW HOWEVER SOME UNIVERSITIES THINK ABOUT HIRING PROFESSORS WHO CAN SPEND MORE TIME IN AREAS WHERE THEY ARE STRONG GERI KERSTIENS IS ONE OF BARANGER'S FORMER CHEMISTRY STUDENTS SHE JUST STARTED A TENURE TRACK JOB IN SANTA CRUZ KERSTIENS WILL TEACH CHEMISTRY BUT ONE OF HER MAIN JOBS IS TO HELP THE UNIVERSITY REVAMP ITS CHEMISTRY PROGRAM SHE SAID SHE WILL DO RESEARCH ON WAYS TO TEACH CHEMISTRY BUT SHE WILL NOT RUN A LABORATORY LIKE MANY PROFESSORS FINDING A JOB THAT CENTERED ON CHEMISTRY EDUCATION WAS A DREAM I FEEL INCREDIBLY LUCKY TO HAVE GOTTEN WHAT I'VE GOTTEN IT WAS LIGHTNING STRIKING IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING I WAS EXPECTING HANNAH LOVE IS A PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR AT PORTLAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN OREGON SHE WAS DENIED TENURE AT A DIFFERENT SCHOOL EARLY IN HER CAREER SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT OPPORTUNITIES SHE WOULD HAVE AFTER THAT NOW HOWEVER SHE IS HAPPY AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE BECAUSE SHE CAN PUT MORE ENERGY INTO TEACHING AND HELPING STUDENTS SHE HAS A CONTINUOUS APPOINTMENT WHICH MEANS IF SHE CONTINUES TO DO GOOD WORK HER JOB IS SAFE SHE SPOKE WITH VOA ABOUT HER EARLIER DISAPPOINTMENT IN RETROSPECT IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE I KIND OF ALWAYS WANTED TO TEACH AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE I THINK I'M EXACTLY WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AND PROFESSIONALLY IT'S A MUCH BETTER FIT BARANGER THE BERKELEY PROFESSOR SAID SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE NON TEACHING EMPLOYEES AT UNIVERSITIES CONSIDERED WITH THE SAME INTENSITY IT MIGHT MAKE THE UNIVERSITY BETTER OVERALL SO IT'S A FILTER THAT'S PRETTY SERIOUS AND I DON'T THINK WE WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT REQUIRED BOTH SO MUCH WORK AND WAS SO FREQUENTLY NEGATIVE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY FIRED EVER I'M DAN

voa-0e6d2147-2060-447c-9f7f-14fe6e30d9373 IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD ATTENDING SCHOOL CAN BE A DAILY STRUGGLE FOR CHILDREN ESPECIALLY GIRLS A LONG LIST OF BARRIERS PREVENTS THEIR ATTENDANCE PARENTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY SCHOOL FEES OR BUY BOOKS OR OTHER SUPPLIES IDEAS ABOUT GENDER CAN ALSO PLAY A PART IN THE PROBLEM SOME FAMILIES THAT NEED HELP AT HOME EXPECT GIRLS TO PERFORM SUCH WORK AND WITH SCHOOLS FAR WAY IN MANY COMMUNITIES THERE IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE FOR GIRLS BEFORE THE COVID NINETEEN HEALTH CRISIS IT IS ESTIMATED THAT AROUND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO MILLION GIRLS WERE OUT OF SCHOOL WORLDWIDE THAT NUMBER COMES FROM THE UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION AFTER THE CORONAVIRUS SPREAD WITH SCHOOLS IN MANY NATIONS CLOSED MILLIONS MORE GIRLS WERE MISSING THEIR STUDIES AT HOME THEY ARE TAKING ON ADDITIONAL HOUSEHOLD DUTIES AND CARING FOR YOUNG AND SICK FAMILY MEMBERS IN ADDITION RESEARCH SUGGESTS AN INCREASE IN UNWANTED MARRIAGES AND VIOLENCE AGAINST GIRLS ESPECIALLY AT HOME DURING THE PANDEMIC CHRISTINA KWAUK IS A GIRLS' EDUCATION EXPERT WITH THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION IN WASHINGTON D C SHE TOLD VOA THAT THE WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CRISIS CAUSED BY COVID NINETEEN HAS LED TO A GIRLS' EDUCATION CRISIS OR WHAT SHE CALLED A GENDER INEQUALITY CRISIS FOR EXAMPLE STAY AT HOME ORDERS HAVE REDUCED GIRLS' ABILITY TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES BUT KWAUK SAID BEING AT HOME HAS NOT MADE GIRLS SAFER THERE IS A HUGE INCREASE IN GENDER BASED VIOLENCE OFTEN SEXUAL VIOLENCE SHE SAID COVID ON ITS OWN WHILE IT DISRUPTED THE LIVES OF EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD IT CREATED SO MANY MORE VULNERABILITIES FOR GIRLS ESPECIALLY ''“ GIRLS AND WOMEN ESPECIALLY A REPORT BY THE EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION ROOM TO READ TALKS ABOUT A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL NAMED VARUNI IN SRI LANKA SHE TAKES PART IN THE GIRLS' EDUCATION PROGRAM THERE WITH SCHOOLS CLOSED SHE WAS AT HOME MORE AND FACED VIOLENCE FROM HER ALCOHOLIC FATHER VARUNI TOLD ROOM TO READ THAT HER FATHER ALSO DOES NOT RESPECT HER RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION THE ORGANIZATION THEN ASKED LOCAL LEADERS TO PERSUADE THE FATHER TO LET VARUNI LIVE WITH ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER WHILE SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED NOW SHE IS NOW LEARNING AGAIN THE GROUP WROTE THE SAME REPORT BY ROOM TO READ EXPLAINED THAT FORTY TWO PERCENT OF THE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND GIRLS THEY SPOKE TO SAID THEIR HOUSEHOLD HAD LOST WAGES DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF COVID NINETEEN ARE A HUGE RISK TO A GIRL'S EDUCATION WHILE SCHOOLS HAVE REMAINED CLOSED MANY ADOLESCENT GIRLS ARE NOT LEARNING AT HOME BECAUSE OF PRESSURE FROM THEIR PARENTS TO TAKE ON MORE HOME DUTIES THAT MEANS FAR LESS OR NO TIME TO STUDY AT HOME THE OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE REPORTS THAT ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS MOST GIRLS ARE NOT ABLE TO LEARN OVER THE RADIO TELEVISION OR INTERNET FAMILIES LACK DEVICES AND ELECTRICITY AND HAVE NO MONEY TO PAY PHONE OR INTERNET COSTS BUT EVEN IN PLACES WHERE ACCESS IS A LITTLE BETTER OFTEN BOYS ARE GIVEN ACCESS BEFORE GIRLS DUE TO GENDER NORMS A REPORT FROM PLAN INTERNATIONAL SAYS THE COVID NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ALSO SHARPLY INCREASED ACTS OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE IN THE HOME AROUND THE WORLD TWO HUNDRED FORTY THREE MILLION WOMEN AND GIRLS BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN TO FORTY NINE HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL OR PHYSICAL VIOLENCE FROM A ROMANTIC PARTNER OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS MANY EXPERTS ARE CALLING THE INCREASE IN SUCH VIOLENCE DURING THE COVID NINETEEN PANDEMIC A SHADOW PANDEMIC HISTORICALLY ECONOMIC CRISES LEAD TO MORE CHILD MARRIAGE AS WELL AS EARLY AND FORCED MARRIAGES AND THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS IS NO EXCEPTION IN INDONESIA FOR EXAMPLE THE GROUP PLAN INTERNATIONAL FOUND THAT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND APPLICATIONS FOR CHILD MARRIAGE WERE SUBMITTED BETWEEN JANUARY AND JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THAT IS A MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE IN APPLICATIONS SINCE TWENTY TWELVE IN TWENTY TWENTY GIRLS IN SOUTHERN ASIA WERE AFFECTED MOST BY THE RISK OF INCREASED CHILD MARRIAGE FOLLOWED BY WEST AND CENTRAL AFRICA THEN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC OR ENVIRONMENTAL SHOCK FAMILIES MAY CHOOSE HARMFUL GENDER CUSTOMS FOR SURVIVAL KWAUK SAYS THAT CAN INCLUDE GIVING A GIRL CHILD AWAY FOR MARRIAGE TO RECEIVE A DOWRY OR PAYMENT IS THE HARD DECISION THAT A FAMILY HAS TO MAKE BUT IF THAT MEANS POTENTIALLY MORE ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR A DAUGHTER THAT'S ONE WAY TO DECREASE SOME OF THAT PRESSURE AND THEN ALSO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE RESOURCES FOR THE HOUSEHOLD THAT'S ALREADY SUFFERING FROM A LOSS OF LIVELIHOOD OR LOSS OF INCOME FOR GIRLS EARLY MARRIAGE CAN LEAD TO PREGNANCY OR JOINING THE WORKFORCE THAT MEANS THEY ARE EVEN LESS LIKELY TO RETURN TO SCHOOL WORLD BANK NUMBERS SHOW THAT SEVERAL COUNTRIES IN ASIA AFRICA LATIN AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST SAW MAJOR INCREASES IN GIRLS' ENROLLMENT IN SCHOOL IN RECENT YEARS BUT THESE GAINS ARE NOW THREATENED BY THE COVID NINETEEN PANDEMIC ECONOMIC SUFFERING FROM POVERTY COMBINED WITH HARMFUL GENDER PRACTICES MAY LEAD TO SOME GIRLS NEVER BEING ABLE TO RETURN TO SCHOOL SOME STUDIES PREDICT THAT ELEVEN MILLION TO TWENTY MILLION GIRLS WILL NOT RETURN TO SCHOOLS WHEN THEY REOPEN AS THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO BECOME ADULTS TOO SOON EVEN FOR GIRLS WHO DO RETURN KWAUK SAYS LEARNING LOSS DURING THE PANDEMIC MAY DISCOURAGE THE GIRLS FROM STAYING IN SCHOOL AND THAT IS SOMETHING NOT DISCUSSED ENOUGH SHE NOTES I'M ALICE BRYANT AND I'M BRYAN LYNN

voa-1092d224-c9c7-4fcb-8af3-974490e6086c3 FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES BETTER THAN FAITH FERBER FERBER BEGAN HER STUDIES AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OR AU IN WASHINGTON D C IN THE AUTUMN OF TWENTY THIRTEEN BY THE FOLLOWING SPRING THE SCHOOL WAS FACING A MAJOR PROBLEM MESSAGES BETWEEN MEMBERS OF AN UNAPPROVED ALL MALE STUDENT GROUP WERE PUBLISHED ONLINE AND GAINED WIDESPREAD PUBLIC ATTENTION THE MESSAGES SHOWED THE MEMBERS OPENLY DISCUSSING THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING RAPE FERBER SOON TOOK ACTION SHE FORMED A GROUP CALLED STUDENTS AGAINST SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND ORGANIZED PROTESTS SHE GOT THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS TO SIGN A STATEMENT DEMANDING THAT SCHOOL OFFICIALS TAKE ACTION AU LATER DISMISSED EIGHTEEN STUDENTS FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE UNAPPROVED GROUP BUT BEFORE THAT TOOK PLACE FERBER BECAME A VICTIM HERSELF IN FEBRUARY TWENTY FIFTEEN SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AT A PARTY SHE TOLD VOA THAT AT FIRST AU OFFICIALS SEEMED SUPPORTIVE OF HER AND HER CASE AGAINST HER ATTACKER BUT AFTER THE INVESTIGATION WAS OVER AND THE SCHOOL BEGAN DECIDING WHAT ACTION TO TAKE THINGS CHANGED FERBER SAID AU OFFICIALS ASKED HER TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT SAYING SHE WOULD NOT DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF HER CASE WITH ANYONE FERBER'S ATTACKER ADMITTED RESPONSIBILITY BUT THE SCHOOL DID NOT DISMISS THAT STUDENT AS SHE REQUESTED SHE THEN LEARNED THAT AU HAD VIOLATED DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RULES GOVERNING HOW COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SHOULD DEAL WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT SO SHE CONTACTED THE AGENCY WHICH EVENTUALLY LED TO AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE SCHOOL THAT INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING FERBER CONTINUES TO FIGHT SEXUAL VIOLENCE THROUGH HER WORK WITH KNOW YOUR NINE THE ORGANIZATION TEACHES COLLEGE STUDENTS HOW TO HOLD THEIR SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE FERBER ARGUES THAT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE U S CANNOT LET FEAR OF CRITICAL MEDIA ATTENTION PREVENT THEM FROM SUPPORTING ABUSE VICTIMS AND SHE ADDS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SEX AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN AMERICA NEED TO CHANGE FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE WE TEACH WOMEN THAT IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT GET RAPED OR TO NOT BE ATTACKED SAID FERBER THAT COMBINED WITH A HESITANCY TO DISCUSS SEX AND CONSENT WITH YOUNG AMERICANS THE RESULT IS THAT KIDS END UP AT COLLEGE LIVING ON THEIR OWN FOR THE FIRST TIME BARELY ADULTS WITH VERY VERY LITTLE INFORMATION IF NOT MISINFORMATION ON HEALTHY SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS SOME SCHOOLS ARE TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM IN OCTOBER THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES OR AAU RELEASED THE FINDINGS OF ITS TWENTY NINETEEN CAMPUS CLIMATE SURVEY ON SEXUAL ASSAULT AND MISCONDUCT THIS STUDY QUESTIONED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS AT THIRTY THREE PUBLIC RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH SEXUAL WRONGDOING IT ALSO ASKED THEM WHAT THEY KNEW ABOUT THEIR SCHOOLS' POLICIES AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR VICTIMS THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO NOTABLE CHANGES IN RATES OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS AT U S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF THE AAU SURVEY THERE WERE SOME NOTABLE IMPROVEMENTS THERE HAS BEEN A RISE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS SAYING THEY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF CONSENT AS WELL AS WHAT CAN BE CONSIDERED ASSAULT AND MORE STUDENTS REPORTED KNOWING HOW TO REPORT AN INCIDENT TO SCHOOL OFFICIALS HOWEVER THIS YEAR'S AAU STUDY FOUND ONE MAJOR ISSUE CONTINUES MANY VICTIMS ARE STILL NOT REPORTING INCIDENTS THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS WHO INFORM THEIR SCHOOLS OR LOCAL POLICE REMAINS LOW AT AROUND FIFTEEN PERCENT ALTHOUGH WE'VE MADE PROGRESS THERE IS MUCH WORK TO DO AAU PRESIDENT MARY SUE COLEMAN WROTE IN A STATEMENT WE NOW KNOW THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD CONTINUE TO CONCENTRATE THEIR EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS AND RESOURCES ON INCOMING FIRST YEAR STUDENTS SINCE THEY ARE CLEARLY MORE VULNERABLE THAN THEIR OLDER CLASSMATES COLBY BRUNO IS THE SENIOR LEGAL COUNSEL WITH THE VICTIM RIGHTS LAW CENTER WHICH OFFERS LEGAL SUPPORT TO PEOPLE AFFECTED BY SEXUAL ASSAULT SHE SAID THE INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF CONSENT IS A PROMISING SIGN AND THE FACT THAT SCHOOLS ARE WILLING TO TAKE PART IN THIS KIND OF RESEARCH SHOWS THEY SEEM WILLING TO TAKE ACTION BUT BRUNO SAYS THE SITUATION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES WILL NOT IMPROVE UNLESS STUDENTS FULLY UNDERSTAND CONSENT ''“ AND SCHOOLS HAVE STRONG POLICIES THEY ARE WILLING TO ENFORCE IF A SCHOOL IGNORES OR IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT ON CAMPUS THEN IT'S NOT JUST A PROBLEM FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED SHE SAID IT'S A LARGER PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE STUDENT BODY BECAUSE THERE IS A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT THAT EXISTS ON THAT CAMPUS BRUNO AND FERBER AGREE THAT WHAT SCHOOLS ALSO NEED IS GUIDANCE FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE U S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP CHANGED GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA THOSE GUIDELINES ADVISED INSTITUTIONS THAT RECEIVE FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID ON HOW TO BEST DEAL WITH INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BRUNO AND FERBER SAY THE CHANGES HAVE WEAKENED SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS I'M Â­DOROTHY GUNDY AND I'M PETE MUSTO

SAME THING COULD HAPPEN DURING THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR IN SOME CASES THE OUTBREAKS HAVE SPREAD FROM THE CAMP TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY THE HIGH INFECTION AREAS HAVE APPEARED AS THE NUMBER OF NEW CASES OF THE CORONAVIRUS IN THE U S HAS BEEN RISING THE CASES HAVE JUMPED MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS FROM AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND A DAY TO AROUND NINETEEN THOUSAND FIVE

'WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL ' YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO SAY IT IS ALL A GOVERNMENT PLOT DOCTOR WILLIAM SCHAFFNER IS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY IN TENNESSEE HE SAID HE IS NOT SURPRISED BY THE OUTBREAKS AT CAMPS HE BELIEVES SOME CAMPS DID NOT CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF OPENING AFTER BEING CLOSED LAST YEAR THE BEST SITUATION WOULD BE FOR CAMPS TO REQUIRE VACCINATIONS FOR ADULTS AND FOR CAMPERS WHO ARE OLD ENOUGH CAMPS CAN ALSO TAKE MEASURES LIKE SERVING MEALS IN SHIFTS PUTTING FEWER CAMPERS IN CABINS AND MAKING UNVACCINATED CAMPERS WEAR FACE COVERINGS INDOORS IN THE HOUSTON TEXAS AREA HEALTH OFFICIALS SAID MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY CHILDREN AND ADULTS TESTED POSITIVE FOR THE VIRUS IN CONNECTION WITH A CHURCH CAMP THE RELIGIOUS LEADER OF CLEAR CREEK COMMUNITY CHURCH IN

ALL STUDENTS TEACHERS WORKERS AND VISITORS AT K THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS WEAR FACE COVERINGS INDOORS ''‹ THE CDC SAYS IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER THE PERSON IS VACCINATED OR NOT SUMMER CAMP OUTBREAKS MAY PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN CHILDREN RETURN TO CLASSROOMS IN THE FALL SAID DOCTOR MICHELLE PRICKETT SHE IS A HEART SPECIALIST AT NORTHWESTERN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN CHICAGO THE EFFECTS WILL DEPEND ON VACCINATION RATES AND WHICH VIRUS VARIANTS ARE WIDESPREAD SHE SAID VANDERBILT'S SCHAFFNER SAID SCHOOLS MAY NOT FACE SIMILAR OUTBREAKS BECAUSE THEY USUALLY HAVE MORE RESTRICTIONS THAN CAMPS BUT HE SAID THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE THE RISK IS TO GET MOST PEOPLE VACCINATED SCHAFFNER SAID PEOPLE IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS FOR EXAMPLE IN TENNESSEE THE TOP VACCINATION OFFICIAL LOST HER JOB AFTER REPUBLICAN STATE LAWMAKERS CRITICIZED HER DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO VACCINATE TEENS THE TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ORDERED COUNTY WORKERS RECENTLY TO STOP COVID NINETEEN

voa-1b6ea297-899d-4e7c-a73c-d73c5650f2403 ABOUT TWO HUNDRED COLLEGE EDUCATORS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE FORMED A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION CALLED THE ACADEMIC FREEDOM ALLIANCE ON ITS WEBSITE THE GROUP SAYS IT AIMS TO HELP COLLEGE EDUCATORS SPEAK INSTRUCT AND PUBLISH WITHOUT FEAR OF SANCTION OR PUNISHMENT THE NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION BEGAN OUT OF DISCUSSIONS AMONG SOME PROFESSORS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY THEY WANTED TO FIND WAYS TO FIGHT AGAINST WHAT THEY SEE AS GROWING INTOLERANCE OF DIFFERING OPINIONS THE AFA PLANS TO SUPPORT THOSE THEY BELIEVE HAVE BEEN UNJUSTLY ATTACKED AND PROVIDE MONEY FOR LEGAL SUPPORT IF NEEDED MEMBERS WHO ARE PROFESSORS WITH TENURE WILL PAY A YEARLY AMOUNT OF FIFTY DOLLARS WHILE OTHERS WILL PAY THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS THE ALLIANCE IS ALSO SEEKING DONATIONS KEITH E WHITTINGTON OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY IS HEAD OF THE ALLIANCE'S ACADEMIC COMMITTEE HE SAID THE GROUP IS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO ADVANCE A NATIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT FREE EXPRESSION ISSUES HE SAID THE GROUP WANTS TO KEEP ALIVE AN IDEA CALLED ACADEMIC FREEDOM WHICH WAS PUT FORWARD BY PROFESSORS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT HAS THREE POINTS THE FIRST IS THE FREEDOM TO TEACH WITHOUT OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE THE SECOND IS THE ABILITY TO DO RESEARCH AND WRITE ON ACADEMIC ISSUES WITHOUT UNIVERSITY LEADERS PREVENTING THE PUBLIC FROM SEEING THE WORK THE THIRD IS THE ABILITY TO SPEAK IN PUBLIC ABOUT IDEAS OF THE DAY WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM UNIVERSITY LEADERS WHITTINGTON SAID WE STILL SEE ALL THOSE THINGS THREATENED AT AMERICAN COLLEGES WHITTINGTON SAID COLLEGE PROFESSORS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT LOSING THEIR JOBS IF THEY EXPRESS IDEAS THAT MIGHT BE UNPOPULAR WITH STUDENTS ADMINISTRATORS OR PEOPLE WHO GIVE MONEY TO THE SCHOOL SOME COLLEGE PROFESSORS HAVE HAD THEIR JOBS THREATENED FOR CRITICIZING UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS WE STILL SEE FACULTY THREATENED FOR ALL THOSE THINGS NOW HE SAID WHITTINGTON AND THE FOUNDERS CREATED THE ORGANIZATION TO OFFER SOME SUPPORT TO THOSE PROFESSORS SOME HE SAID JOINED THE GROUP FOR THAT REASON MEMBERS OF THE AFA INCLUDE WRITER AND POLITICAL ACTIVIST CORNEL WEST WHO RECENTLY LEFT HARVARD UNIVERSITY AFTER NOT RECEIVING TENURE AND RETIRED VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR CAROL SWAIN OTHERS IN THE ALLIANCE INCLUDE CONSTITUTIONAL RESEARCHER SANFORD LEVINSON AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SCHOOL OF LAW AWARD WINNING WRITER CHARLES JOHNSON A RETIRED PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AND NADINE STROSSEN A RETIRED PROFESSOR AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION WHITTINGTON SAID A NUMBER OF PROFESSORS WHO JOINED THE AFA WERE NERVOUS AT FIRST ABOUT JOINING SOME HE SAID WERE WORRIED THAT THEIR SUPPORTERS WOULD BE CONCERNED IF THEY JOINED A GROUP THAT HAD MEMBERS WHO EXPRESSED OPPOSING POLITICAL OPINIONS BUT WHITTINGTON DESCRIBED THE AFA AS A GENUINELY CROSS IDEOLOGICAL GROUP AND IT WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO PERSUADE PEOPLE THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE OUT IN FRONT AND STANDING UP FOR THESE PRINCIPLES EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES THAT WOULD MEAN DEFENDING SPEECH THAT THEY FOUND PRETTY UNPLEASANT AND VERY WRONGHEADED AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES THAT WOULD LEAD THEM TO BE PERSONALLY CRITICIZED SOME MEMBERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN FREE SPEECH DISPUTES FOR EXAMPLE SOME STUDENTS CRITICIZED NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR LAURA KIPNIS FOR A DOCUMENT SHE WROTE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IN THE WRITING KIPNIS DISPUTED THE SCHOOL'S BAN ON TEACHERS AND STUDENTS DATING EACH OTHER ANOTHER HARVARD PROFESSOR AND LANGUAGE RESEARCHER STEVEN PINKER WAS CRITICIZED IN TWENTY ELEVEN BY MEMBERS OF THE LINGUISTIC SOCIETY OF AMERICA FOR SUPPOSED INSENSITIVITY TO RACISM AND SEXISM WHITTINGTON SAID THE ALLIANCE WOULD CENTER ON FREE SPEECH AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM ISSUES HE NAMED TWO RECENT EXAMPLES OF WHY HE SAYS THE ALLIANCE IS NEEDED ONE EXAMPLE INVOLVED UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PROFESSOR GREG PATTON LAST SUMMER HE WAS TEACHING USING THE VIDEO CONFERENCING APPLICATION ZOOM ABOUT WORDS USED TO FILL SILENCES IN SPOKEN LANGUAGE HE DESCRIBED A FEW CHINESE TERMS THAT SOME STUDENTS BELIEVED SOUNDED LIKE AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE RACIAL INSULT PATTON WAS SUSPENDED AND ONLY RETURNED AFTER A SCHOOL INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE USE OF THE MANDARIN TERM HAD AN ACTUAL PURPOSE ALSO LAST SUMMER AUBURN UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR JESSE GOLDBERG FACED CALLS FOR HIS DISMISSAL AFTER WRITING A MESSAGE ON TWITTER THE MESSAGE INCLUDED THE POLICE DO NOT PROTECT PEOPLE THEY PROTECT CAPITAL THEY ARE INSTRUMENTS OF VIOLENCE ON BEHALF OF CAPITAL AUBURN UNIVERSITY DENOUNCED THE MESSAGE AND REASSIGNED GOLDBERG FROM THE CLASSROOM TO A RESEARCH POSITION WHITTINGTON SAID THE AFA SEEKS TO FIGHT AGAINST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS AND SANCTION PROFESSORS WHO HOLD NON TRADITIONAL OR UNPOPULAR OPINIONS IT'S ESSENTIAL I THINK THAT WE CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE THAT WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO ARTICULATE WHAT THESE PRINCIPLES ARE AND WHY THEY'RE IMPORTANT AND WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO DEFEND INDIVIDUAL PROFESSORS WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN THE MIDST OF THESE CONTROVERSIES WHITTINGTON SAID HE HOPED THE AFA MIGHT START OFF WITH ABOUT FIFTY PROFESSORS WHO COULD HELP SPREAD THEIR MESSAGE BUT THE GROUP RECEIVED STRONG SUPPORT AND GAINED MORE MEMBERS THAN THAT THE GROUP WILL START BY WORKING FOR ITS MEMBERS IN CASE OF CONTROVERSY BUT WHITTINGTON SAID IT ALSO WANTS TO LOOK OUT FOR NON MEMBERS WHO MAY BE INVOLVED IN SITUATIONS WHERE SUPPORT FROM THE AFA MIGHT BE HELPFUL I'M JONATHAN EVANS AND I'M DAN FRIEDELL

voa-1c0a0df2-a6ef-4c75-a7e6-232840a2cc583 TEACHERS EVERYWHERE ARE FACING THE NEW SCHOOL TERM WITH ONE BIG PROBLEM HOW TO TEACH STUDENTS SAFELY IN THE MIDDLE OF A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC HAMISU HAMISU HARUNA TEACHES ENGLISH AT AL QALAM UNIVERSITY IN KATSINA NIGERIA HE SAYS THAT WHEN THE PANDEMIC CAME HE DID NOT HESITATE OR SLOW DOWN TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE WAY HE WAS TEACHING I BELIEVE ONE THING THAT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE IS ATTAINABLE AND THERE'S NO WORD 'IMPOSSIBLE ' WHAT MATTERS IS TRYING YOU TRY AND TRY UNTIL YOU GET THE RIGHT THING SO ALTHOUGH PROGRESS IS COMING STEADILY BUT SURELY NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME AND THAT'S WHY WHEN THIS ISSUE OF CORONAVIRUS CAME AND ALL LIVES ARE SHIFTED TO ONLINE I DIDN'T HESITATE STARTING IT HARUNA ADDED THAT HE TOLD OTHER EDUCATORS ABOUT ONLINE PROGRAMS OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING AND CONFERENCES TO HELP THEM MOVE THEIR TEACHING ONLINE HE HIMSELF LEARNED NEW SKILLS FROM THE U S STATE DEPARTMENT'S E TEACHER PROGRAM IT OFFERS FREE ONLINE CLASSES FOR TEACHERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN COOPERATION WITH U S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH GOING ONLINE IN NIGERIA IS THE COST OF DATA FOR CELLULAR PHONE USERS HARUNA NOTED THAT ONE WAY TEACHERS DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM IS BY COMBINING TWO METHODS OF GIVING LESSONS ONE IS SYNCHRONOUS LEARNING ''“ WHERE THE TEACHER AND STUDENTS ARE PRESENT TOGETHER ONLINE AT THE SAME TIME THAT IS IN ADDITION TO AND HELPS SUPPORT ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING ''“ WHERE THE STUDENT GOES ONLINE TO GET THE TEACHER'S LESSON AT A LATER TIME AND IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THAT HIGH COST OF DATA WE USUALLY USE WHATSAPP PLATFORM BY RECORDING OUR LECTURES AND SENDING THE LECTURE TO THEM HARUNA SAID THAT AFTER TEACHERS RECORD TWO LECTURES AND PUBLISH THE RECORDINGS ONLINE THEY OFTEN USE VIDEO CONFERENCING TO TALK WITH STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE WE USE BOTH SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS ONLINE LEARNING WE USE ZOOM AS PART OF THE SYNCHRONOUS ONE WHERE WE SCHEDULE MEETINGS WITH THE STUDENTS JUST FOR THIRTY MINUTES TO SERVE AS A DISCUSSION MEETING AND THE PURPOSE OF ORGANIZING OF SCHEDULING THIS MEETING IS JUST FOR THE STUDENTS AND THE TEACHER TO INTERACT BY ASKING QUESTIONS THEY CAN USE THE THIRTY MINUTES TO ASK THE QUESTION TO THE TEACHER AND THE TEACHER CAN EASILY RESPOND HARUNA REPORTS THAT BOTH STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS HAVE REACTED WELL TO THIS METHOD OF TEACHING SO BY SO DOING WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE QUITE A LOT AND THE STUDENTS ARE REALLY FOLLOWING THE CLASSES AND THEY ARE REALLY APPRECIATING THE CLASSES BECAUSE IT SERVES AS SOMETHING WHICH IS NEW TO THEM AND THEY REALLY ACCEPT IT AND EVEN THE PARENTS ALSO CONTRIBUTE IMMENSELY BY COOPERATING SOME PARENTS EVEN USED TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN THEIR PHONE FOR THEM TO USE FOR THE SAKE OF THE CLASSROOM ANOTHER TEACHER WHO TOOK PART IN THE E TEACHER PROGRAM IS EGYPT'S SHEREEN MOHAMED SHE RECORDS HER CLASSES BY USING AN INTERACTIVE DEVICE AT SCHOOL THEN STUDENTS HAVE TWO WAYS TO GET THE TEACHING MATERIALS THEY CAN WATCH THEM ON YOUTUBE OR FOR THOSE LACKING AN INTERNET CONNECTION THE SCHOOL PROVIDES A COMPACT DISC CD OR A DATA STORAGE DEVICE WITH THE RECORDINGS TO MAKE SURE HER STUDENTS ARE LEARNING MOHAMED SAYS THEY HAVE TO TAKE TESTS THAT SHE CREATES ON THE QUIA WEBSITE OR ON QUIZLET YET SHE WARNS THAT IT IS NOT WISE TO ONLY USE THESE ONLINE PLATFORMS I THINK IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE SOME ASSESSMENT FOR MY STUDENTS THEY MUST HAVE SOME EXAMS REAL EXAMS TO EVALUATE THEIR PROGRESS HOW CAN I EVALUATE IT ONLINE IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT BUT I THINK I SHOULD SEND THEM AN INTERACTIVE WORKSHEET TO ANSWER IT DURING THE ONLINE SESSION TO CHECK THEIR UNDERSTANDING IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS I SHOULD RETURN BACK TO THE LESSON AND RE PRESENT OR MAKE A DIFFERENT PRESENTATION ABOUT THE ITEM IN THE NEW TERM MOHAMED PLANS TO USE FLIPGRID AN APP THAT CAN HELP STUDENTS MAKE VIDEOS TO SHARE WITH THEIR TEACHERS AND CLASSMATES SHE HOPES THIS SOFTWARE PROGRAM WILL GIVE STUDENTS A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THEY ARE LEARNING THE HEAD TEACHER AT MOHAMED'S SCHOOL HAS ASKED HER TO TRAIN OTHER TEACHERS IN USING TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR CLASSES IN THE PHILIPPINES THE NEW SCHOOL TERM HAS BEEN DELAYED UNTIL OCTOBER FIFTH GLEN CORTEZANO TEACHES AT THE LOS BAÃ±OS CAMPUS OF LAGUNA STATE POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY SHE SAID SHE LED AN ONLINE CLASS TO HELP TEACHERS MOVE TO THE NEW NORMAL WE KNOW THAT LEARNING SHOULD NEVER STOP RIGHT AND WE SHOULD ALWAYS FIND WAYS WE ALWAYS FIND WAYS EVEN IF WE CANNOT MEET FACE TO FACE SHE ADDED THAT HER UNIVERSITY IS USING A MODULAR APPROACH TO EDUCATE STUDENTS WHO HAVE NO INTERNET AT ALL CORTEZANO IS PART OF A TEAM OF CURRICULUM CHECKERS THEY EXAMINED THE EDUCATION PROGRAM OF ALL THE TEACHERS WE WILL BE CHECKING THE OBJECTIVES THE ACTIVITIES THE STRATEGIES THE LECTURE THE ASSESSMENT WE REACHED OUT TO OUR STUDENTS AND WE HAD THIS SURVEY WHO AMONG OUR STUDENTS DO HAVE THE INTERNET ACCESS WHO AMONG OUR STUDENTS DID NOT HAVE IT OUR UNIVERSITY WILL BE PRINTING ALL OUR MODULES AND THEY WILL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE TO DELIVER THE MODULES TO OUR STUDENTS WHEREVER THEY ARE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM CORTEZANO SAYS IS ORGANIZING CLASSES THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL SKILLS OR EQUIPMENT HOW ABOUT THE PHYSICAL EDUCATION SUBJECT HOW CAN YOU TEACH SWIMMING HOW CAN YOU TEACH SPORTS DANCING AND IN LABORATORY WE HAVE BAKING AND WE ALSO HAVE FOOD NUTRITION AND DIETETICS SO WE WERE ASKED TO GIVE ONLY THE THEORIES IT'S ACTUALLY DIFFICULT TO ASK THEM TO DO THE EXPERIMENT AT HOME THE TEACHERS WORKED TOGETHER TO CREATE LESSON PLANS FOR ALL THEIR CLASSES AND HAVE SENT THEM TO BE REPRODUCED AND GIVEN TO STUDENTS WHEN IT IS TIME TO RETURN THEIR WORK STUDENTS DROP OFF EACH LESSON AT A GOVERNMENT OFFICE WHERE IT IS SENT TO THE UNIVERSITY GLEN CORTEZANO SHEREEN MOHAMED AND HAMISU HAMISU HARUNA HAVE ALL COMPLETED THE U S STATE DEPARTMENT'S E TEACHER PROGRAM THEY LEAD TRAINING PROGRAMS ON USING TECHNOLOGY FOR TEACHING ONLINE FOR MORE

voa-23b4daf8-2725-432f-865c-f7de02b88f9d3 ALL OVER THE WORLD MORE AND MORE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BECOMING INVOLVED IN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES IN MANY CASES HIGHER EDUCATION IS RELATED TO OR EVEN AT THE CENTER OF THEIR ACTIVISM THE PROTEST MOVEMENT IN HONG KONG WAS ONE OF THE TOP NEWS STORIES OF TWENTY NINETEEN MANY OF THOSE LEADING THE ANTI GOVERNMENT PROTESTS WERE YOUNG PEOPLE SOME DEMONSTRATORS SOUGHT SHELTER FROM POLICE IN UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS MORE RECENTLY DEMONSTRATIONS BEGAN SPREADING ACROSS INDIA AFTER AN ATTACK ON PROTESTERS AT A UNIVERSITY IN NEW DELHI SOME COLLEGE AGE ACTIVISTS HAVE EVEN TURNED AGAINST HIGHER EDUCATION THIS WEEK STUDENTS IN CHILE RESTARTED PROTESTS AGAINST WHAT THEY CALL AN UNFAIR UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS SYSTEM AND A FEW YEARS AGO PROTESTS AGAINST THE HIGH COST OF STUDY PROGRAMS HIT NEARLY EVERY UNIVERSITY IN SOUTH AFRICA NOÃ«LLA RICHARD SAYS STUDENTS IN MANY PLACES HAVE BECOME MORE POLITICALLY ACTIVE IN RECENT YEARS BECAUSE THEY ARE TIRED OF WAITING FOR THEIR VOICES TO BE HEARD RICHARD IS YOUTH GLOBAL PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME SHE ARGUES THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING EDUCATED YOUNG ADULTS IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY SEE THE WORLD IN SIMILAR WAYS THEY ARE HIGHLY INFORMED ABOUT MAJOR INTERNATIONAL ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND WANT PEACE BOTH IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY AND WORLDWIDE SHE SAYS THEY ALSO WANT TO CHANGE CONDITIONS THAT HAVE LED TO PROBLEMS IN THE PAST BUT YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT SEE THOSE IN POWER WORKING TOWARDS THOSE GOALS OR REPRESENTING THEM IN THE WAY THEY WANT TO BE REPRESENTED RICHARD SAYS SO THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO TAKE ACTION AND PRODUCE CHANGE IN DIFFERENT WAYS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S NECESSARILY VIOLENT THAT DOESN'T MEAN NECESSARILY THAT IT IS RADICAL ALTHOUGH ALSO BEING RADICAL IS NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING BUT IT'S JUST EXPLORING NEW FORUMS SHE TOLD VOA IN YEMEN A NOT FOR PROFIT GROUP HAS WORKED WITH YOUNG PEOPLE TO FIGHT DRUG ABUSE AND AVOID EXTREMIST GROUPS IN KOSOVO A YOUTH LED ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN DEVELOPING AN EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAM AND IN PAKISTAN ANOTHER GROUP HAS YOUNG BUSINESSMEN WORKING TOGETHER TO PREVENT RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS FROM TAKING CONTROL OF THEIR BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED STATES COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE SHOWN THEIR INTEREST IN POLITICS IN A MORE TRADITIONAL WAY VOTING IN ELECTIONS LAST SEPTEMBER TUFTS UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE FOR DEMOCRACY AND HIGHER EDUCATION PUBLISHED ITS LATEST NATIONAL STUDY OF LEARNING VOTING AND ENGAGEMENT THE STUDY EXPLORES THE VOTING RECORDS AND DATA FOR ABOUT TEN MILLION AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENTS IT FOUND THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO VOTED IN U S ELECTIONS MORE THAN DOUBLED BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN ADAM GISMONDI IS DIRECTOR OF IMPACT AT THE INSTITUTE HE SAYS THAT COLLEGE STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES DATES BACK HUNDREDS OF YEARS IN U S POLITICS THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS OF HEAVY STUDENT INVOLVEMENT SUCH AS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND LOW INVOLVEMENT AS IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES DURING THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS THE OVERALL PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS VOTING REACHED ITS HIGHEST LEVEL IN OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS SOME POLITICAL OBSERVERS HAVE LINKED THIS WITH THE RISE OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AS A POLITICAL FIGURE WITH MANY PEOPLE WANTING TO VOTE FOR OR AGAINST HIM BUT GISMONDI ARGUES THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS AROUND NATIONAL POLITICS AND THERE'S BEEN ATTENTION PAID TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND SOME OF THE POLICIES AS A RESULT OF HIS ELECTION GISMONDI SAID BUT I WILL SAY THERE'S SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DATA OUT THERE THAT SHOWS THAT A LOT OF THE ACTIVISM THAT WE'RE SEEING IS ISSUE BASED IT'S NOT NECESSARILY PARTY BASED MANY OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES OF THE DAY ARE ONES THAT COLLEGE EDUCATED AMERICANS HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ON SAYS GISMONDI THESE INCLUDE GUN CONTROL IMMIGRATION REFORM AND THE RISING COSTS OF HEALTHCARE AND HIGHER EDUCATION BUT ANOTHER REASON POLITICAL ACTIVISM AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE HAS RISEN IS U S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THEMSELVES SAYS CLARISSA UNGER SHE IS DIRECTOR OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT FOR YOUNG INVINCIBLES A NON PROFIT GROUP THAT SUPPORTS YOUTH POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT UNGER SUGGESTS THAT MANY SCHOOLS HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO INCREASE STUDENT POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT THEY TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE STUDENTS STAY INFORMED ABOUT ISSUES SOME PROVIDE RESOURCES THAT INFORM STUDENTS HOW TO REGISTER TO VOTE AND OFFER VOTING CENTERS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS UNGER AND GISMONDI AGREE THAT AS A RESULT MANY STUDENTS ARE NOT JUST BECOMING INVOLVED IN NATIONAL POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS THEY ARE ALSO VOTING AND SOMETIMES EVEN COMPETING LOCALLY AS CANDIDATES FOR ELECTED POSITIONS AND UNGER NOTES LEADERS WHO IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION RISK LOSING THEIR POWER AT THE END OF THE DAY YOUNG PEOPLE WANT AUTHENTIC LEADERS SHE SAID THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR POLITICIANS SAYING WHAT THEY THINK THEY WANT TO HEAR THEY WANT TO BE HEARD AND THEY WANT AUTHENTIC LEADERS WHO ARE TAKING THEM SERIOUSLY TAKING THEIR CONCERNS SERIOUSLY NOÃ«LLA RICHARD ADDS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT NOT JUST BE LIMITED TO THE COLLEGE EDUCATED THERE ARE MANY POOR AND UNEDUCATED YOUNG PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WHO DO NOT JUST DESERVE AN EQUAL VOICE SHE SAYS THEY POSSESS VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND OPINIONS ALL THINGS LEADERS MUST CONSIDER WHEN MAKING ANY DECISIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE I'M DOROTHY GUNDY

TESTS TO UNDERSTAND THE PROGRESS OF THEIR STUDENTS THE SAME TEST IS GIVEN TO EVERY STUDENT IN EACH GRADE THE RESULTS OF THOSE TESTS IN NORTH CAROLINA HAVE NOT BEEN GOOD MORE THAN HALF OF THE STUDENTS WHO TOOK EXAMS IN MATH AND BIOLOGY RECEIVED A RATING OF NOT PROFICIENT THE MATH EXAMINATION GIVEN TO STUDENTS IN NINTH GRADE RESULTED IN SIXTY SIX POINT FOUR PERCENT OF STUDENTS GETTING THE NOT PROFICIENT RATING A YEAR AGO FORTY EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT RECEIVED THAT RATING JONATHAN PLUCKER IS A PROFESSOR AT THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF EDUCATION HE SAID IT MAY TAKE TWO YEARS TO MAKE UP THE GAP IN LEARNING IF WE DON'T FIND WAYS TO HELP THEM START TO CATCH UP THESE GAPS ARE GOING TO GET BIGGER HE SAID MANY SCHOOL SYSTEMS AROUND THE U S ARE EXPECTING TO RECEIVE INCREASED MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE COMING YEARS SOME OF THE MONEY WILL PAY FOR INTERNET LEARNING AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER PROGRAMS SCHOOLS HOPE THAT STUDENTS WILL GO BACK TO CLASSES IN PERSON GET EXTRA HELP AND IMPROVE THEIR GRADES BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE STUDENTS WHO WILL BE APPLYING TO COLLEGE THIS YEAR OR NEXT OLDER HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS LIKE THOSE WHO WILL BE GRADUATING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO MAY NO LONGER HAVE GRADES COLLEGES WILL LIKE SOME HIGH SCHOOLS EVEN CHANGED THE WAY THEY GIVE GRADES CLASSES WHERE THE BEST STUDENTS ONCE RECEIVED AN A GRADE HAVE CHANGED TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS PASS/FAIL THIS HURTS STUDENTS WHO DID WELL IN THOSE CLASSES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT SHOW COLLEGES A GOOD LETTER GRADE AT THE END OF THE TERM SOME STRONG UNIVERSITIES IN THE U S ALSO DECIDED THEY WOULD NOT REQUIRE STUDENTS TO TAKE THE SAT ACT OR ADVANCED PLACEMENT TESTS MANY GROUP TESTS WERE CANCELED WHEN THE CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS BARRED LARGE EVENTS THOSE SCHOOLS ARE NOW CONSIDERED TEST OPTIONAL SOME OF THEM INCLUDE UNIVERSITIES LIKE NEW YORK UNIVERSITY COLGATE UNIVERSITY AND HARVARD UNIVERSITY SO HOW CAN A COLLEGE EVALUATE A STUDENT WITHOUT TRADITIONAL GRADES AND TEST SCORES ERIC HOOVER WRITES ABOUT COLLEGE ADMISSIONS FOR THE CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION HE SAID UNIVERSITIES ARE GETTING USED TO THE IDEA OF MAKING ADJUSTMENTS AND ALLOWANCES FOR THE MANY THINGS THAT ARE MISSING FROM STUDENTS' HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS IN ADDITION HE SAID TOP COLLEGES HAVE HAD TO LOOSEN ALL KINDS OF RULES AND STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS THIS YEAR THAT IS BECAUSE QUALIFIED STUDENTS COULD NOT SHOW RECORDS THAT HAD LETTER GRADES FOR EVERY CLASS ABOUT A YEAR AGO A PROJECT ORGANIZED BY THE HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION HELPED THE HEADS OF ADMISSIONS FROM THREE HUNDRED COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SAY WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS IT WAS CALLED MAKING CARING COMMON THE DOCUMENT SAYS STUDENTS SHOULD BE SURE TO LET THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THEY FACED DURING THE PANDEMIC UNIVERSITIES SAID THEY UNDERSTAND THAT MANY AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES WERE CANCELED THEY ALSO KNOW THAT STUDENTS MAY HAVE HAD TO TAKE A JOB OR HELP CARE FOR A SICK FAMILY MEMBER SOME OF THE SCHOOLS THAT SIGNED ON TO THIS DOCUMENT WERE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY CALTECH HAMILTON COLLEGE JOHNS HOPKINS THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA HOOVER AND OTHERS AT THE CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION SPENT A LOT OF TIME WRITING ABOUT THE WAY ADMISSIONS OFFICERS THOUGHT ABOUT STUDENTS WHO WOULD BE GRADUATING EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC THOSE STUDENTS HAVE NOW BEEN ACCEPTED TO COLLEGE NOW UNIVERSITIES ARE CONSIDERING THE NEXT GROUP OF STUDENTS HE SAID THEY WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC'S LONG TAIL SO STUDENTS MIGHT FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME WHEN THEY FINALLY GET BACK TO IN PERSON LEARNING EITHER THIS SPRING OR IN THE FALL BUT I THINK COLLEGES ARE NOT EXPECTING STUDENTS TO LEAP OVER THE MOON WHEN VOA CONTACTED A NUMBER OF UNIVERSITIES TO DISCUSS HOW THEY WILL CONSIDER FUTURE STUDENTS' GRADES THEY CHOSE NOT TO ANSWER EVEN WITH THE PROBLEMS OF THE LAST YEAR HOOVER SAID COLLEGES WANT TO SEE THAT STUDENTS FOUND A WAY TO TAKE ON DIFFICULT PROJECTS ALSO HE SAID THEY SHOULD NOT GIVE UP ON GETTING GOOD GRADES THAT IS BECAUSE COLLEGES MAY BE TEST OPTIONAL BUT NO ONE'S GOING GRADE OPTIONAL WITHOUT A LOT OF NORMAL ACTIVITIES LIKE SPORTS THEATER AND MUSIC COLLEGES ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT STUDENTS BASED ON HOW SERIOUSLY THEY TAKE THEIR STUDIES COLLEGES ARE OFTEN IMPRESSED WITH STUDENTS WHO IN ADDITION TO GETTING GREAT GRADES PARTICULARLY IN THE SUBJECTS THAT THEY PLAN TO STUDY IN COLLEGE AND MAJOR IN BUT ALSO TAKE THOSE INTERESTS OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM RIGHT INTO THEIR COMMUNITY INTO OTHER KINDS OF CONTEXTS THE PANDEMIC MAY HAVE CAUSED COLLEGES TO CHANGE HOW THEY JUDGE STUDENTS BUT THEY STILL WANT STUDENTS WHO TAKE LEARNING SERIOUSLY AND WILL DO WELL IN THE UNIVERSITY SETTING I'M DAN FRIEDELL

EFFORT BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IT SOUGHT TO INFLUENCE THE WAY AMERICAN HISTORY INCLUDING SLAVERY AND RACE ARE DISCUSSED IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TRUMP ORDERED THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ESTABLISH A GROUP CALLED THE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX COMMISSION ITS STATED JOB WAS TO BETTER ENABLE RISING GENERATIONS TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY AND PRINCIPLES OF THE FOUNDING OF THE UNITED STATES IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX HOWEVER CRITICS SAID THE GROUP TOLD A ONE SIDED STORY ABOUT THE MEN WHO HELPED ESTABLISH THE UNITED STATES '' KNOWN AS THE FOUNDING FATHERS THEY ARGUED THE COMMISSION TOLD SCHOOLS TO REDUCE THE IMPORTANCE OF SLAVERY WHEN TELLING THE STORY OF THE EARLY DAYS OF THE COUNTRY THE COMMISSION RELEASED ITS REPORT ON JANUARY EIGHTEENTH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HOPED IT WOULD PROVIDE GUIDANCE ABOUT HISTORY TEACHING IN THE COUNTRY BUT CRITICS SAID IT INSULTED MANY IDEAS OF EDUCATION DAVID BLIGHT IS A CIVIL WAR HISTORIAN AT YALE UNIVERSITY HE CALLED THE DOCUMENT PRODUCED BY TRUMP'S COMMISSION A PIECE OF RIGHT WING PROPAGANDA OBSERVERS NOTED THAT THE REPORT SEEMED TO BE AN ANSWER TO THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT IT IS A SERIES OF STORIES PUBLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN IN THE NEW YORK TIMES NEWSPAPER THE STORIES ARE ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF SLAVERY ON THE BRITISH COLONIES THAT WOULD BECOME THE UNITED STATES THE NEW YORK TIMES COLLECTION WAS RELEASED DURING THE FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE YEAR HISTORIANS BELIEVE SLAVES WERE FIRST BROUGHT TO THE AREA THAT WOULD BECOME THE UNITED STATES THE STORIES TALKED ABOUT HOW AFRICAN SLAVES PROVIDED FREE LABOR IN SOME COLONIES THE WRITERS ARGUED THAT SLAVES MADE THE AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE IN THE WORLD THEY SAID THAT SLAVERY BEGAN HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF RACISM AND POOR CONDITIONS FROM WHICH BLACK PEOPLE HAVE YET TO FULLY RECOVER THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT WON THE PULITZER PRIZE AND RESULTED IN A PODCAST THE NEW YORK TIMES SAID IT LOOKS AT HOW SLAVERY STARTED NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT HAS TRULY MADE AMERICA EXCEPTIONAL PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN CANCELLED THE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX COMMISSION WITH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ON THE FIRST DAY OF HIS PRESIDENCY JANUARY TWENTIETH HOWEVER STATE LEADERS WHO SUPPORTED THE COMMISSION STILL WANT TO INFLUENCE HOW PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS AND PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES DISCUSS THE EFFECTS OF SLAVERY AND RACISM IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA A LAWMAKER ASKED THE LEADER OF THE STATE'S UNIVERSITY SYSTEM TO INVESTIGATE HOW TEACHERS TALK ABOUT WHITE PRIVILEGE WHITE PRIVILEGE IS A TERM USED TO DESCRIBE THE ADVANTAGES THAT COME JUST FROM BEING WHITE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY THE TERM APPEARED A LOT IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY AFTER PROTESTS OVER RACIAL EQUITY TOOK PLACE FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD HE WAS A BLACK MAN WHO DIED WHILE BEING RESTRAINED BY POLICE IN MINNEAPOLIS MINNESOTA LAWMAKERS IN GEORGIA ASKED THE STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM TO SURVEY ITS PROFESSORS ON THE ISSUE OF WHITE PRIVILEGE ENGLISH PROFESSOR MATTHEW BOEDY TEACHES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH GEORGIA HE SAW THE SURVEY HE SAID IT IS DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE PROFESSORS AND CALLED IT AN ATTACK ON HIGHER EDUCATION THE DEBATE IS NOT ONLY IN GEORGIA STATES INCLUDING ARKANSAS AND IOWA ARE DEALING WITH THE SAME ISSUES REPRESENTATIVE FROM ARKANSAS MARK LOWERY CALLED SLAVERY A DARK STAIN ON U S HISTORY BUT SAID THE NEW YORK TIMES SERIES REDUCED THE IMPORTANCE OF FOUNDING FATHERS LIKE GEORGE WASHINGTON AND THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO WERE SLAVE OWNERS NIKOLE HANNAH JONES IS A REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES AND CREATOR OF THE PROJECT SHE SAID THE NEW YORK TIMES SERIES IS NOT SUPPOSED TO REPLACE WHAT SCHOOLS TRADITIONALLY TEACH IT IS SUPPOSED TO ASK PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CAME FROM SLAVERY SOME HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE USING THE EDUCATIONAL PLANS THAT GO WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES PROJECT TO PROVIDE THEIR STUDENTS WITH A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF SLAVERY JONATHAN ROGERS IS AN ENGLISH TEACHER IN IOWA HE SAID THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT IS VALUABLE IT HELPED HIS STUDENTS THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT SOURCES OR ALTERNATIVE STORYTELLING HE SAID ONE PROPOSAL IN OKLAHOMA CALLS FOR TEACHERS TO LOSE THEIR JOBS IF THEY TEACH DIVISIVE ISSUES IN SOUTH DAKOTA THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED ADDING ALMOST ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE'S BUDGET TO MAKE SURE SCHOOLS TEACH THAT THE U S IS THE MOST UNIQUE NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD TATE REEVES IS GOVERNOR OF MISSISSIPPI HE PROPOSED THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO FIGHT AGAINST WHAT HE CALLED REVISIONIST HISTORY OR THE CHANGING OF TRADITIONAL HISTORIC ACCOUNTS HE SAID TEACHERS AROUND THE U S HAVE PLACED ATTENTION ON WHAT HE CALLED AMERICA'S SHORTCOMINGS OVER THE EXCEPTIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS COUNTRY ARKANSAS'S GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON SAID WHAT IS TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS IS SOMETHING THAT

voa-2ba7b067-3262-4a5e-ac96-edbc33fe9d013 IF YOU LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE MOST PEOPLE SPEAK THE LANGUAGE YOU ARE LEARNING YOU MAY USE THE LANGUAGE FOR SEVERAL HOURS EACH DAY SO IT MAY BECOME PART OF YOUR INNER SPEECH IN OTHER WORDS YOU START THINKING IN THAT LANGUAGE YOUR MIND STOPS TRYING TO TRANSLATE THINGS FROM YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE INTO THE SECOND LANGUAGE BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE VOA LEARNING ENGLISH AUDIENCE LIVES IN PLACES WHERE ENGLISH IS NOT THE MAIN LANGUAGE THIS MAY BE TRUE FOR YOU YOU MAY NOT HAVE MANY CHANCES TO PRACTICE ENGLISH YOU MAY EVEN BE SELF TAUGHT WHEN YOU SPEAK YOUR SPEECH MIGHT BE SLOWER THAN YOU WOULD LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE YOUR MIND IS STILL TRANSLATING FROM YOUR FIRST LANGUAGE WHICH CAN ALSO SOUND UNNATURAL ENGLISH LIKE EVERY OTHER LANGUAGE HAS ITS OWN SENTENCE STRUCTURE THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THINKING IN ENGLISH CAN BRING YOU A HUGE STEP CLOSER TO FLUENCY IT IS NOT VERY DIFFICULT BUT IT DOES TAKE CONSCIOUS EFFORT AND PRACTICE ON TODAY'S EDUCATION TIPS WE WILL SHARE SOME MENTAL EXERCISES THAT CAN HELP MOST EXPERTS NOTE THAT IT'S BEST TO START SMALL SO A GOOD FIRST STEP IS TO THINK IN INDIVIDUAL WORDS LOOK AROUND YOU WHAT DO YOU SEE IN YOUR HEAD TRY TO NAME EACH OBJECT IN YOUR SURROUNDINGS CHARLES THOMAS HAS TAUGHT ENGLISH TO UNION MEMBERS CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS FOR OVER TEN YEARS HE HAS ALSO HELPED OPEN SCHOOLS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES HE CURRENTLY WORKS FOR EF INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS IN WASHINGTON D C THOMAS TELLS HIS STUDENTS TO NAME THE THINGS THAT THEY SEE AROUND THEM WHEREVER THEY ARE AS YOU CONTINUE WITH THIS IT BECOMES MORE OF A HABIT SO THINGS ARE GOING TO POP UP INTO YOUR HEAD ''“ COMPUTER TELEPHONE CHAIR DESK WHATEVER IT IS WHEREVER YOU ARE START WITH NOUNS AND THEN ADD IN VERBS HE SUGGESTS HE SAYS YOU CAN ALSO DO THIS AT HOME WHEN YOU WAKE UP AND BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP TEACHER ANDREW HINSHAW ALSO FINDS THIS EXERCISE HELPFUL HE HAS BEEN TEACHING ENGLISH FOR TWELVE YEARS INCLUDING IN VIETNAM FOR THE U S DEPARTMENT OF STATE HE CURRENTLY TEACHES AT THE CARLOS ROSARIO INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL IN WASHINGTON D C HINSHAW REMEMBERS ONE METHOD SOME OF HIS VIETNAMESE STUDENTS LIKED I'VE HAD STUDENTS TELL ME THAT THEY LABEL EVERYTHING IN THEIR ROOM OR THEIR APARTMENTS SO THAT THESE ENGLISH WORDS KIND OF STICK IN THEIR HEADS ANOTHER EXERCISE THAT BOTH THOMAS AND HINSHAW SUGGEST IS DESCRIBING IN YOUR MIND OBJECTS YOU DON'T KNOW THE WORDS FOR AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE IF YOU COULDN'T THINK OF THE WORD GARAGE THOMAS SAYS IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR HOUSE AND YOU SEE YOUR GARAGE BUT YOU CAN'T THINK OF THE NAME IN ENGLISH YOU CAN SAY 'THE PLACE INSIDE WHERE I PUT MY CAR ' OR YOU CAN SAY 'IT'S NEXT TO MY HOUSE I KEEP THINGS THERE ' HE SAYS YOU CAN ALSO USE SHORTER PHRASES SUCH AS IT'S SIMILAR TO OR IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF HINSHAW SAYS DOING THIS CAN HELP LEARNERS OF ANY LANGUAGE AS A SPANISH LEARNER HE DOES IT HIMSELF THE NEXT EXERCISE IS THINKING IN SIMPLE SENTENCES FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE SITTING IN A PARK YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF THINGS LIKE IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY AND PEOPLE ARE PLAYING SPORTS WITH THEIR FRIENDS ONCE THIS BECOMES EASY YOU CAN MOVE ON TO MORE DIFFICULT SENTENCES HINSHAW SOMETIMES USES THIS EXERCISE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS TO SAY TO PEOPLE IN SPANISH I DEFINITELY TRY TO SAY THESE SENTENCES IN MY HEAD OR TRY TO PUT THE WORDS TOGETHER WITHOUT THINKING TOO MUCH ABOUT IF IT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT ANOTHER EXERCISE EXPERTS SUGGEST IS TO DESCRIBE YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES THERE ARE A FEW WAYS TO DO THIS THOMAS ASKS HIS BEGINNING LEVEL STUDENTS TO DESCRIBE THEIR DAY USING THE SIMPLE PRESENT VERB FORM SO THEY WOULD THINK TO THEMSELVES THINGS LIKE I PUT ON MY SHIRT AND HE DRIVES THE BUS OTHER EXPERTS SAY YOU CAN MENTALLY MAKE PLANS IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP THIS WOULD REQUIRE OTHER VERB TENSES SO THE SKILL LEVEL IS A LITTLE HIGHER FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT TELL YOURSELF WHEN I LEAVE THE HOUSE I'M GOING TO GET AN ICED COFFEE THEN I'LL TAKE THE TRAIN TO CLASS I'M STUDYING WITH PAOLA TODAY SHE SAID SHE BOOKED A STUDY ROOM AT THE LIBRARY FOR TWO P M NOW LET'S MOVE TO THINKING IN CONVERSATION WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU ARE IMAGINING YOURSELF SPEAKING TO SOMEONE ELSE YOU ARE ASKING THE QUESTIONS AND THINKING OF REPLIES THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO PRACTICE WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY IN A REAL CONVERSATION FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THE IMAGINARY PERSON ASKS YOU A QUESTION LIKE WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE AWARD SHOW LAST NIGHT HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER IMAGINE THE CONVERSATION AND PRACTICE IT IN YOUR HEAD YOU CAN DO THIS OUT LOUD OR IN SILENCE FOR ALL OF THESE EXERCISES THERE WILL OF COURSE BE WORDS AND PHRASES THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW SO AT SOME POINT YOU WILL NEED TO USE A DICTIONARY IF YOUR SKILL LEVEL IS HIGH ENOUGH YOU MIGHT CONSIDER USING AN ENGLISH TO ENGLISH DICTIONARY HINSHAW SUGGESTS WRITING DOWN JUST FIVE TO TEN NEW WORDS AND PHRASES EACH DAY KEEPING A NOTEBOOK HE SAYS HELPS YOU REMEMBER THE SITUATION THAT YOU NEEDED THAT WORD OR PHRASE FOR THIS MAKES IT EASY TO RECALL WHEN YOU ARE IN SUCH A SITUATION AGAIN SO HOW MUCH TIME SHOULD YOU SPEND ON THESE EXERCISES THOMAS SAYS DO A LITTLE EVERY DAY SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT EVERY DAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN LITTLE BY LITTLE THAT'S THE KEY BECAUSE WHEN YOU MAKE THINGS A HABIT THEN IT JUST POPS UP INTO YOUR MIND WITHOUT THINKING AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT REALLY YOU'RE THINKING IN ENGLISH I'M ALICE BRYANT

voa-3916c3b9-07cf-46a7-913c-9b5a8cb210cd3 OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS IN THE UNITED STATES THE EXPRESSION CRITICAL RACE THEORY OR CRT HAS APPEARED IN STATEHOUSES AND POLITICAL GATHERINGS FROM ALMOST NOWHERE CRT HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT CAUSE FOR CONSERVATIVES MANY REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED STATES HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION RESTRICTING HOW HISTORY AND RACE CAN BE TAUGHT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR SOME CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING HOW RACE HAS SHAPED AMERICAN SOCIETY AND PUBLIC POLICY FOR OTHERS CRT CREATES DIVISION AND CONFLICT BETWEEN WHITE PEOPLE AND MINORITIES BUT EVEN THOSE WHO CRITICIZE CRITICAL RACE THEORY HAVE A HARD TIME DEFINING WHAT IT IS SO WHAT EXACTLY IS IT CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS A WAY OF THINKING ABOUT AMERICA'S HISTORY THROUGH RACE IT ARGUES THAT RACISM IS MORE THAN JUST INDIVIDUAL PREJUDICES AND DISCRIMINATION CRT CENTERS ON THE IDEA THAT RACISM IS SYSTEMIC IN THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS THE THEORY ALSO ARGUES THAT THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS WORK TO KEEP WHITE PEOPLE AS THE MOST POWERFUL GROUP UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS AND OTHERS IN ACADEMIA DEVELOPED CRT DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND NINETEEN EIGHTIES IN RESPONSE TO WHAT THEY VIEWED AS A LACK OF RACIAL PROGRESS THE CREATORS OF THE THEORY ARGUE THAT THE U S WAS FOUNDED ON STOLEN LAND AND LABOR THROUGH THE COLONIZATION OF NATIVE LAND AND SLAVERY SUPPORTERS OF THE THEORY ALSO BELIEVE RACE IS NOT BIOLOGICAL BUT CULTURALLY INVENTED KIMBERLÃ© CRENSHAW IS THE HEAD OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN POLICY FORUM AND ONE OF THE EARLIEST SUPPORTERS OF CRT AT FIRST THE THEORY WAS SIMPLY ABOUT TELLING A MORE COMPLETE STORY OF WHO WE ARE THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS BEING TAUGHT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS BUT SOME IDEAS RELATING TO THE THEORY ARE BEING TAUGHT TASSIE ZAHNER IS AN ADVANCED PLACEMENT OR AP AMERICAN HISTORY TEACHER IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY MARYLAND AP IS A NATIONWIDE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH COLLEGE LEVEL CLASSES SHE SAID IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO TEACH HER CLASS WITHOUT USING SOME CRT CONCEPTS LIKE AMERICA'S HISTORY OF RACISM IN ORDER TO TEACH AN AP U S HISTORY CLASS CORRECTLY YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS SHE SAID YOU CAN'T PREPARE STUDENTS IF YOU'RE NOT TEACHING THE TRUTH ABOUT U S HISTORY BUT SOME PARENTS AND CONSERVATIVE LAWMAKERS SEE SOME USES OF THE THEORY AS PROBLEMATIC IN GREENWICH CONNECTICUT SOME MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS WERE GIVEN A WHITE BIAS SURVEY WHICH ANGERED SOME PARENTS THE WAKE COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IN NORTH CAROLINA ORGANIZED A MEETING FOR TEACHERS ON CRITICAL RACE THEORY ANGERING STATE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS LISA LUTEN IS A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE WAKE COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM NORTH CAROLINA IS ONE OF THE TWENTY SIX STATES THAT HAVE PROPOSED LAWS THAT RESTRICT CRITICAL RACE THEORY OR LIMIT HOW TEACHERS CAN DISCUSS RACISM OR SEXISM SAYS THE PUBLICATION EDUCATION WEEK CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS NOT SOMETHING WE TEACH TO STUDENTS LUTEN SAID IT'S MORE OF A THEORY IN ACADEMIA ABOUT RACE THAT ADULTS USE TO DISCUSS THEIR ENVIRONMENT MANY CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS SAY CRT IS AN EFFORT TO REWRITE AMERICAN HISTORY THEY ARGUE CRT TELLS WHITE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE NATURALLY RACIST AND SHOULD FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE OF THEIR PRIVILEGES BUT THE TERM CRITICAL RACE THEORY HAS RECENTLY BEEN USED AS A GENERAL DESCRIPTION FOR RACIAL IDEAS THAT CONSERVATIVES DISLIKE THESE INCLUDE WHITE PRIVILEGE SYSTEMIC INEQUALITY AND INHERENT BIAS OUT OF THE TWENTY SIX STATES THAT HAVE CONSIDERED LEGISLATION EIGHT HAVE BANNED OR LIMITED THE TEACHING OF CRT AND SIMILAR IDEAS THE BANS ALL FROM REPUBLICAN LED STATES LARGELY DESCRIBE WHAT CAN BE TAUGHT INSIDE THE CLASSROOM WHILE LEGISLATION IN SOME STATES MENTIONS CRITICAL RACE THEORY BY NAME OTHERS DO NOT MANY ARE UNCLEAR ABOUT WHAT SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE TAUGHT OTHER STATES HAVE BANNED TEACHING THE NEW YORK TIMES' THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT RELEASED IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT AIMED TO TELL A STORY OF AMERICAN HISTORY WITH SLAVERY AT THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY'S FOUNDING THE BANNING OF CRT IDEAS HAS EXTENDED TO OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL IN LATE JUNE AUSTRALIA'S SENATE VOTED TO REMOVE CRT FROM THE NATIONAL SCHOOL SYSTEM THE CONVERSATION REPORTED THAT SOME POLITICIANS AND MEDIA GROUPS WERE CONCERNED THAT AUSTRALIA'S SCHOOLS WERE TEACHING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE OPPRESSION DISCRIMINATION AND STRUGGLES OF INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS TEACHERS' GROUPS EDUCATORS AND SOCIAL STUDIES ORGANIZATIONS WORRY THE LAWS WILL MAKE STUDENTS GET AN UNTRUE PICTURE OF AMERICAN HISTORY THEY SAY IT IS VERY DAMAGING FOR STUDENTS TO THINK THAT RACISM DISCRIMINATION AND PAST INJUSTICES DO NOT AFFECT THE COUNTRY TODAY EDUCATION WEEK ARGUES IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE LAWS THAT PLACE LIMITS ON WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE INDIVIDUAL CLASSROOMS BUT SOME EDUCATORS FEAR THAT THE LAWS COULD SCARE TEACHERS INTO CHANGING WHAT AND HOW THEY TEACH ABOUT RACE ZAHNER SAID LAWMAKERS AND ADULTS PASS THESE KINDS OF LAWS BECAUSE THEY UNDERESTIMATE THE ABILITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO THINK CRITICALLY SHE SAID STUDENTS DO NOT NEED TO DEPEND ON THE ANALYSIS OF HISTORIANS AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OFTEN THEY CAN READ DOCUMENTS OR OTHER INFORMATION FROM THE PAST AND LEARN FOR THEMSELVES ZAHNER ADDED THAT REFUSING TO PERMIT CHILDREN TO STUDY CRT MEANS YOU'RE TAKING AWAY BOTH THE KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR ABILITY TO ANALYZE THINGS I'M DAN NOVAK AND I'M

voa-3bd1b65c-aac9-4642-b9ad-dede30091bf13 THE INTERNET HAS LED TO MAJOR CHANGES IN NEARLY EVERY AREA OF MODERN LIFE HIGHER EDUCATION INCLUDED MANY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE CREATED INTERNET BASED STUDY PROGRAMS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF TODAY'S STUDENTS BUT A GROWING NUMBER OF EXPERTS SAY MORE CHANGE IS REQUIRED A RECENT STUDY FROM AN AMERICAN NON PROFIT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION SUGGESTS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MUST ALSO EXPAND WHAT THEY ARE TEACHING RESEARCHERS FOUND A NEED FOR SCHOOLS TO ADD INTERNET USE TRAINING TO THEIR STUDY PROGRAMS THIS TRAINING THEY SAY SHOULD CENTER ON HOW TO BEST USE THE INTERNET TO FIND TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION THE HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AND THE JOHN S AND JAMES L KNIGHT FOUNDATION ESTABLISHED PROJECT INFORMATION LITERACY IT EXAMINES HOW COLLEGE STUDENTS FIND PROCESS AND USE INFORMATION IN JANUARY THE ORGANIZATION RELEASED FINDINGS FROM AN OPINION STUDY OF THIRTY SEVEN PROFESSORS AND OVER ONE HUNDRED COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THE STUDY FOUND THE CURRENT GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO GREW UP USING THE INTERNET ON A USUAL BASIS IS HIGHLY DISTRUSTFUL OF MUCH OF THE INFORMATION THEY FIND ONLINE THEY QUESTION HOW INTERNET COMPANIES USE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS KNOWN AS ALGORITHMS TO DECIDE WHAT INFORMATION USERS SEE DISCUSSION OF THE ALGORITHMS AND HOW THEY AFFECT ONLINE INFORMATION IS ALSO LACKING IN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CLASSROOMS THE STUDY FOUND ALGORITHMS AFFECT NEARLY EVERY PART OF A PERSON'S EXPERIENCE ON THE INTERNET NOTES MARGY MACMILLAN A LEADING RESEARCHER WITH PROJECT INFORMATION LITERACY SHE SAYS IT RELATES TO HOW INTERNET COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK MAKE MONEY SEARCH ENGINES LIKE GOOGLE ARE MOST PEOPLE'S ENTRY TO THE INTERNET SAYS MACMILLAN IF A PERSON WANTS TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT SOMETHING THEY USUALLY START WITH GOOGLE'S SEARCH BAR AS SOON AS THEY START TYPING OR CHOOSING LINKS GOOGLE'S ALGORITHM STARTS GATHERING DATA ABOUT EVERY CHOICE USERS MAKE GOOGLE USES THAT DATA TO TRY TO FIND THE WEBSITES OR INFORMATION THAT MOST DIRECTLY RELATE TO WHAT THE USER IS LOOKING FOR MACMILLAN SAYS BUT COMPANIES ALSO PAY GOOGLE TO POST ADVERTISEMENTS FOR PRODUCTS THAT COULD RELATE TO USERS' SEARCH DATA FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SEARCH FOR PLACES TO TAKE A VACATION YOU WILL LIKELY START TO SEE ADS FOR TRAVEL COMPANIES FLIGHTS OR HOTELS THERE ARE ALSO POSSIBLE HARMFUL USES OF THE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS THERE ARE ALGORITHMS THAT ARE DECIDING WHO GETS A LOAN AND WHO DOESN'T BASED ON INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THAT PERSON LIVES MACMILLAN TOLD VOA THERE ARE ALGORITHMS BEING USED TO DETERMINE HEALTHCARE THERE ARE ALGORITHMS BEING USED IN DECIDING WHO GETS A JOB WE'RE SEEING GOVERNMENTS USE IT FOR DECISION MAKING IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PART OF THE DIFFICULTY WITH ALGORITHMS IS WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHICH INFORMATION THEY'RE DRAWING FROM THE PROBLEM WITH ALGORITHMS LIKE THOSE OF GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK IS THAT THEY CAN LIMIT THE KINDS OF INFORMATION PEOPLE SEE SAYS MACMILLAN FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT NEWS STORIES ON A WEBSITE RUN BY PEOPLE WITH A GIVEN SET OF POLITICAL BELIEFS THE ALGORITHM REMEMBERS THOSE CHOICES THE NEXT TIME YOU SEARCH FOR NEWS YOUR SEARCH ENGINE WILL LIKELY PRESENT MORE STORIES FROM WEBSITES THAT ALSO EXPRESS THOSE BELIEFS AND POLITICAL ADS THAT REPRESENT THOSE BELIEFS MAY START TO APPEAR IN YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA FEED MACMILLAN ARGUES THIS CAN BE HARMFUL TO PEOPLE'S CRITICAL THINKING AND LEAD THEM TO BELIEVE THAT ONLY ONE POINT OF VIEW IS THE CORRECT ONE PROJECT INFORMATION LITERACY FOUND THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THAT COMPANIES GATHER THEIR DATA AND DIRECT THEIR INTERNET USE THEY ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS THE STUDY SHOWED SO MANY STUDENTS ARE SHARING METHODS FOR AVOIDING ALGORITHMIC CONTROLS THIS INCLUDES CREATING FALSE ONLINE ACCOUNTS SO SEARCH RESULTS ARE UNAFFECTED BY EARLIER SEARCHES ALSO A GROWING NUMBER OF STUDENTS ARE CHOOSING TO USE A WIDE VARIETY OF WEBSITES SO THAT THEY GET INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES RENEE HOBBS ARGUES THAT ALGORITHMS ARE NOT ALL BAD SHE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE MEDIA EDUCATION LAB AT THE UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND HOBBS SAYS SEARCH ENGINE ALGORITHMS CAN HELP YOU FIND WHAT MIGHT BE THE MOST USEFUL INFORMATION FASTER BUT SHE SAYS IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF INTERNET COMPANIES TO KEEP USERS ON THE INTERNET FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO THEY SEE MORE ADS SO SEARCH ENGINE ALGORITHMS FOR EXAMPLE NOT ONLY USE YOUR SEARCH HISTORY TO DECIDE WHAT TO SHOW YOU THEY ALSO PRESENT LINKS AND INFORMATION THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO GET YOUR ATTENTION AND NOT NECESSARILY THOSE THAT ARE TRUTHFUL OR TRUSTWORTHY THAT IS WHY SHE AND MARGY MACMILLAN AGREE THAT AS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ASK STUDENTS TO USE THE INTERNET MORE IN THEIR STUDIES SCHOOLS MUST TRAIN THEM HOW TO DO SO THIS IS ALSO KNOWN AS ALGORITHM LITERACY WHICH THEY SAY PROFESSORS SHOULD INCLUDE IN CLASS DISCUSSIONS HOBBES SAYS PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE PART OF THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO AVOID SOME OF THE RISKS AND HARMS THAT CAN COME FROM NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW ALGORITHMS SHAPE THE CONTENT WE RECEIVE MACMILLAN SAYS IT IS THE DUTY OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO KEEP THE POPULATION INFORMED ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND THEM YET IT IS NOT THE DUTY OF HIGHER EDUCATION ALONE SHE SAYS NEWS AGENCIES NEED TO REPORT MORE ABOUT HOW INTERNET COMPANIES USE ALGORITHM PERSONALIZATION AND AMERICAN LAWMAKERS SHOULD CONSIDER INCREASING DATA PROTECTION RULES I'M Â­JILL ROBBINS AND I'M PETE MUSTO

BEFORE SCHOOLS ARE TAKING NEW ACTIONS TO FIGHT COVID NINETEEN INFECTIONS ON CAMPUS SUCH ACTIONS INCLUDE MOVING SUDDENLY BETWEEN IN PERSON AND ONLINE LEARNING PUNISHING STUDENTS FOR ATTENDING PARTIES AND TESTING LOCAL WASTEWATER FOR THE VIRUS THE STATE OF ARKANSAS' DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH REPORTS THAT THE NUMBER OF COVID NINETEEN CASES IN THE STATE AMONG EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS ROSE BY

UNIVERSITIES THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE INFECTIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS' MAIN CAMPUS IS CLOSE TO ONE THOUSAND MOST OF THOSE WITH THE VIRUS ARE STUDENTS THE RISE CAME DAYS AFTER THE SCHOOL MOVED TO RESTRICT ON CAMPUS EVENTS AND OFF CAMPUS PARTIES THE SCHOOL TOLD STUDENTS IT WOULD CONSIDER ORGANIZING OR ATTENDING LARGE GATHERINGS WITHOUT FACE COVERINGS OR SOCIAL DISTANCING TO BE A VIOLATION OF

DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH HE SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT THE TEMPORARY STOP OF FACE TO FACE TEACHING WOULD GIVE THE SCHOOL TIME TO WATCH THE INCREASING NUMBER OF CASES HE NOTED THAT RECENT PARTIES WERE A LIKELY CAUSE FOR THE RISE IN INFECTIONS HE SAID THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT CROWDED INDOOR GATHERINGS SUCH AS THOSE THAT OCCURRED OVER THE WEEKEND CAN SERVE AS SUPER SPREADER

voa-4241136d-2149-4b0f-8660-49961c8a075e3 THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GIVING A RECORD AMOUNT OF PANDEMIC AID TO THE NATION'S SCHOOLS PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S ADMINISTRATION IS HOPING SCHOOLS USE THE MONEY TO IMPROVE DEEP PROBLEMS WITHIN THE NATION'S SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT MANY DISTRICTS SAY THEY HAVE MORE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS TO SOLVE FIRST DETROIT MICHIGAN IS A POOR CITY WITH A LONG STRUGGLING SCHOOL SYSTEM THE CITY IS USING THE FEDERAL MONEY TO FIX BUILDINGS WITH STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THE DISTRICT IS ALSO USING SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT MONEY TO HIRE MORE TEACHERS HAVE SMALLER CLASSES AND PROVIDE MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT AT LEAST HALF OF THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL AID IS BEING USED TO REPAIR SCHOOL BUILDINGS NIKOLAI VITTI LEADS DETROIT PUBLIC SCHOOLS HE SAID FOR DECADES WE HAVE BEEN INEQUITABLY FUNDED TO DEAL WITH THE ENORMOUS NEEDS THAT POVERTY AND RACIAL INJUSTICE HAVE CREATED IN OUR CITY WITH THE PANDEMIC MONEY HE SAID THE DISTRICT WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO WORK TOWARD FIXING THE PROBLEM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS PUSHED SCHOOLS TO MAKE LARGE CHANGES WITH THE MONEY EDUCATION SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA HAS CALLED IT A TIME FOR BIG IDEAS HE SAID DISTRICTS COULD USE THE MONEY TO LESSEN INEQUALITY BUT MANY LARGE CITY DISTRICTS ARE PUTTING THE PANDEMIC MONEY TOWARDS SHORT TERM NEEDS SCHOOLS HAVE USED THE AID TO HIRE MEDICAL WORKERS PUT MORE BOOKS IN LIBRARIES AND BRING BACK ART CLASSES SO FAR THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF MAJOR CHANGE SAID MARGUERITE ROZA SHE IS A SCHOOL FINANCE EXPERT WITH GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY PART OF THE PROBLEM SHE SAID IS THAT THE AID WAS GIVEN TO SCHOOLS WITH FEW REQUIREMENTS ABOUT HOW TO SPEND IT THE MONEY WAS GIVEN AS BLANK CHECKS TO EVERY ONE OF THESE DISTRICTS ROZA SAID AND MANY ARE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO THE PANDEMIC AID IS BIGGER THAN ANYTHING AMERICAN SCHOOLS HAVE SEEN BEFORE IT TOTALS ONE HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT SPENDS ON SCHOOLS IN A USUAL YEAR CONGRESS HAS SENT THE FUNDING TO SCHOOLS IN THREE ROUNDS SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC THE LAST AND LARGEST ROUND TOTALS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING LITTLE TO STUDY HOW SCHOOLS ARE USING THE MONEY SOME STATES ARE REQUIRED TO RELEASE SPENDING PLANS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT MANY ARE NOT SOME REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS HAVE PUSHED FOR A NEW LAW THAT WOULD GIVE THE PUBLIC MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW DISTRICTS ARE USING THE MONEY REPORTERS WITH THE ASSOCIATED PRESS LOOKED AT HOW MUCH MONEY WAS GIVEN TO ALMOST EVERY DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY THEY TRACKED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SENT TO STATES SINCE LAST YEAR THE MEDIAN AID GIVEN TO DISTRICTS WAS NEARLY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT BUT THAT AMOUNT DIFFERS WIDELY BY DISTRICT AND STATE THE AP REPORTS THE MEDIAN FUNDING PER STUDENT IN LOUISIANA AND WASHINGTON D C WAS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT IN UTAH IT WAS ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED POORER DISTRICTS RECEIVED MUCH MORE MONEY DETROIT RECEIVED THE MOST AMONG BIG CITY DISTRICTS AT MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT IT WAS FOLLOWED BY PHILADELPHIA WITH THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT AND CLEVELAND AT MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SCHOOLS HAVE THREE YEARS TO SPEND THE LATEST ROUND OF FUNDING BUT DISTRICTS SAY THAT IS A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TO USE SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY SOME SCHOOL OFFICIALS DO NOT WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON THINGS THEY CANNOT PAY FOR AFTER THE FEDERAL AID IS GONE IN ST PAUL MINNESOTA THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IS GETTING THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FUNDING DISTRICT LEADER JOE GOTHARD SAYS THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TO SPEND THE MONEY LIMITS HOW HE CAN USE IT THE DISTRICT HAS HIRED SOME NEW TEACHERS BUT IT IS MOSTLY USING THE MONEY FOR THINGS LIKE BUILDING REPAIRS AND REPLACING LIBRARY BOOKS DISTRICTS ACROSS THE U S HAVE SPENT THE SUMMER DEBATING HOW TO SPEND THE NEW MONEY THEY HAVE FACED PRESSURE FROM GROUPS OF PARENTS AND OTHERS SOME FAMILIES WANT MORE MONEY TO GO TO SPECIAL EDUCATION OTHERS WANT MORE TEACHER TRAINING THAT EXAMINES RACISM AT THE SAME TIME DISTRICTS ARE FACING PRESSURE TO INCREASE TEACHER PAY SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOL DISTRICT IS RECEIVING THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PANDEMIC AID THE DISTRICT'S TEACHERS UNION HAS CALLED FOR SMALLER CLASS SIZES WHICH WOULD MEAN MORE TEACHERS AS WELL AS PAY INCREASES THE UNION IS NOT ASKING THAT THE FUNDING SHOULD COME FROM THE FEDERAL AID BUT THE UNION IS MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE EXTRA FUNDING MEANS THE DISTRICT CAN OFFER PAY RAISES THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS SAYS THE FEDERAL AID SHOULD CENTER ON IMPROVING SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND CLASSROOM SUPPORT BUT PRESIDENT RANDI WEINGARTEN ALSO SAID PAY RAISES ARE NEEDED TO KEEP TEACHERS FROM QUITTING AFTER A DIFFICULT YEAR ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN FOR SCHOOLS IS STATE FUNDING THERE IS WORRY THAT THE FEDERAL MONEY WILL GIVE STATES REASON TO CUT FUTURE EDUCATION BUDGETS IN DETROIT VITTI SEES A CHANCE TO ASK FOR MORE STATE FUNDING HE HOPES TO SHOW THAT THE FEDERAL AID HAD IMPROVED THINGS FOR STUDENTS AND INCREASED GRADUATION RATES WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SHOW CLEAR OUTCOMES FROM THIS INVESTMENT HE SAID HE WANTS TO PROVE TO STATE LAWMAKERS THAT SIMILAR FUNDING SHOULD BE CONTINUED IN AN EQUITABLE WAY I'M DAN NOVAK AND I'M DAN FRIEDELL

voa-433ec9a3-ffcf-4789-8e6d-f0ece19d63513 PEOPLE INVOLVED IN HIGHER EDUCATION ARE ASKING WILL UNIVERSITIES REQUIRE STUDENTS TO GET THE CORONAVIRUS VACCINE BEFORE THEY COME BACK TO SCHOOL MANY UNIVERSITIES ALREADY REQUEST HEALTH INFORMATION FROM NEW STUDENTS MOST ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM THE U S ALREADY RECEIVE VACCINES AS CHILDREN SCHOOLS LIKE THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN FOR EXAMPLE DO NOT REQUIRE STUDENTS TO BE VACCINATED FOR MANY DISEASES BUT STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THEM VACCINES ARE RECOMMENDED FOR DISEASES LIKE HEPATITIS AND MEASLES A FORM ASKS STUDENTS TO CHECK WITH THEIR DOCTORS AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO GET ANY MISSING IMMUNIZATIONS BEFORE YOU COME TO CAMPUS AS THE CORONAVIRUS VACCINE BECOMES MORE AVAILABLE STUDENTS MAY SOMEDAY BE REQUIRED TO PROVE THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED THE CORONAVIRUS VACCINE BEFORE COMING TO SCHOOL BUT PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS SAY IT IS UNLIKELY UNIVERSITIES WILL BE ABLE TO REQUIRE IT THIS FALL THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IS ANOTHER LARGE UNIVERSITY WITH OVER FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS VOA ASKED WHETHER THE SCHOOL WILL REQUIRE A CORONAVIRUS VACCINE IN THE NEAR FUTURE A UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SPOKESMAN ANSWERED BY EMAIL AT THIS TIME THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE REQUIRING A COVID VACCINE FOR FACULTY STAFF OR STUDENTS HE WROTE RUPALI LIMAYE IS SCIENTIST AT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY IN BALTIMORE MARYLAND SHE IS AN EXPERT IN VACCINES AND PUBLIC HEALTH SHE STUDIES HOW PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT VACCINES LIMAYE SAID IT IS LIKELY UNIVERSITIES WILL ENTER THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR STILL USING OTHER METHODS TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS EVEN IF SOME STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS HAVE RECEIVED THE VACCINE THESE METHODS INCLUDE WEARING A FACE COVERING VIRUS TESTING SOCIAL DISTANCING AND KEEPING GROUPS OF STUDENTS TOGETHER IN SMALL GROUPS LIMAYE SAID THE MOST LIKELY SITUATION THIS FALL IS THAT SOME STUDENTS WILL BE VACCINATED BUT MOST SOCIAL DISTANCING RULES WILL REMAIN IN PLACE UNIVERSITIES HOWEVER WILL PROBABLY URGE STUDENTS TO TAKE CLASSES IN PERSON LIMAYE SAID THE CORONAVIRUS HEALTH CRISIS HAS MADE UNIVERSITIES THINK HARD ABOUT THE BEST WAYS TO TEACH STUDENTS WHILE MANY SCHOOLS HAVE DEPLOYED DISTANCE LEARNING IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE MAJORITY OF THEM BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO TEACH IS IN PERSON MOST ADULTS SHE SAID CAN EFFECTIVELY WORK FROM HOME BUT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE IS THE SOCIAL INTERACTION AND COOPERATION THAT COME ON CAMPUS SO MANY UNIVERSITIES WANT TO FIND A WAY TO REOPEN SOME PEOPLE ARE HOPEFUL THAT COLLEGE CAMPUSES WILL BE BACK TO NORMAL IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE VACCINES ARE BECOMING MORE AVAILABLE LIMAYE SAID THAT IS CLOSER TO A DREAM THAN REALITY THAT IS BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES WILL RECEIVE THE VACCINE BY THE START OF THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR SOME OLDER TEACHERS AND PROFESSORS WILL HAVE BEEN VACCINATED BUT COLLEGE AGE STUDENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN PRIORITIZED BY MOST PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS FOR THIS REASON HERD IMMUNITY MAY NOT BE REACHABLE SEVEN MONTHS FROM NOW THE TERM HERD IMMUNITY DESCRIBES A SITUATION WHEN ENOUGH PEOPLE IN A POPULATION ARE RESISTANT TO A DISEASE THAT IT CANNOT SPREAD LIMAYE SAID STATES WITH SMALLER POPULATIONS LIKE KENTUCKY ARE DOING A BETTER JOB OF PROVIDING VACCINES COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THOSE STATES MIGHT BE ABLE TO WELCOME STUDENTS BACK TO CAMPUS WITH FEWER RULES IN PLACE IN LARGER STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA IT HAS BEEN HARDER TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH VACCINES AS A RESULT ON CAMPUS SOCIAL DISTANCING RULES MAY REMAIN IN PLACE FOR A LONGER TIME IN ADDITION UNIVERSITIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REQUIRE A CORONAVIRUS VACCINE THAT IS BECAUSE THE VACCINES ARE ONLY BEING GIVEN TO THE PUBLIC UNDER EMERGENCY USE RULES LIMAYE SAID THAT HER SCHOOL JOHNS HOPKINS RECENTLY REQUIRED EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PART OF THE MEDICAL CAMPUS WHO MEET WITH PATIENTS TO RECEIVE A FLU SHOT EACH YEAR COULD WE GO DOWN THAT ROUTE SHE ASKED ABOUT POSSIBLY REQUIRING THE VACCINE IT IS A TRICKY SUBJECT SHE SAID IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT SCHOOLS WILL TRY TO INCREASE IN PERSON ATTENDANCE BY REQUIRING FACE COVERINGS FOR A LONG TIME TO COME HALLIE BUSTA IS A REPORTER FOR HIGHER ED DIVE A WEBSITE THAT COVERS HIGHER EDUCATION SHE SAID COLLEGES UNDERSTAND STUDENT VACCINATION WILL BE IMPORTANT TO GETTING BACK TO NORMAL THE LEADERS OF COLLEGES ARE ALSO AWARE THE VACCINE IS NOT GOING TO BE WIDELY AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS FOR SOME TIME I'VE SEEN ESTIMATES OF THAT BEING LIKE LATE SPRING OR EARLY SUMMER SO I THINK THEY'RE HOPEFUL BUT ALSO REALISTIC ABOUT SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS ON HOW SOON COLLEGE STUDENTS CAN GET VACCINATED AND THEN IN TURN HOW THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT THEIR PLANS FOR THE SPRING TERM AND EVEN INTO THE FALL THE AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH ASSOCIATION WORKS ON STUDENT HEALTH POLICY BUSTA SAID THE ORGANIZATION HAS ASKED THE U S CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION TO CONSIDER RECOMMENDING THAT COLLEGES VACCINATE STUDENTS BEFORE THEY LEAVE FOR THE SUMMER THE ORGANIZATION NOTES THAT DOING SO WOULD PREVENT COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT HAVE SYMPTOMS OF THE VIRUS FROM INFECTING PEOPLE AT HOME BUSTA SAID THE U S GOVERNMENT IS ONLY MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW VACCINES SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC IT IS EACH STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE ACTION SO SOME STATES COULD DECIDE TO PLACE TOP IMPORTANCE ON THEIR UNIVERSITY COMMUNITIES WHICH INCLUDE STUDENTS THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN ASKING AS WELL BUSTA SAID IS THERE A REASON TO PRIORITIZE A CERTAIN GROUP STUDENTS AND UNIVERSITY STAFF MEMBERS MAY CHOOSE TO RECEIVE A VACCINE AS SOON AS IT IS AVAILABLE BUT BEFORE STUDENT LIFE CAN RETURN TO NORMAL PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR COLLEGE CAMPUSES NEED TO GET THE VACCINE TOO EVEN IF STUDENTS ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT GETTING THE VACCINE AND ARE ABLE TO GET IT IT ALSO MATTERS FOR COLLEGES WHETHER PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT SURROUND THEIR CAMPUSES ARE ALSO GETTING VACCINATED AND ARE ABLE TO AND THAT COULD BE A FACTOR AS WELL THAT SCHOOLS NEED TO CONSIDER INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ARE PART OF NEARLY EVERY UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY IN THE U S WILL THOSE STUDENTS BE REQUIRED TO BE VACCINATED BEFORE THEY RETURN TO CAMPUS BOTH BUSTA AND LIMAYE SAY IT IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY ANSWERED LIMAYE SAID SHE VALUES HER INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AT THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY SHE SAID HER CONCERN IS WHETHER INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WHO ARE IN ONE OR TWO YEAR GRADUATE PROGRAMS WILL GET THE EXPERIENCE THEY WOULD LIKE SHE SAID SHE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO FINDING OUT MORE ON RULES FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS COMING BACK THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BIT OF AN EVOLVING SITUATION SHE SAID BUSTA SAID INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WERE ALREADY STARTING TO CONSIDER UNIVERSITIES

voa-46cb5321-3b59-427a-8b75-fc7291e21b8d3 AS GROWING NUMBERS OF YOUNG PEOPLE REPORT STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ARE WORKING TO MEET THEIR STUDENTS' NEEDS BUT A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS THAT ONE GROUP OF STUDENTS IS FACING THESE ISSUES MORE THAN ANY OTHER TRANSGENDER STUDENTS AND SOME EXPERTS WORRY THAT MANY SCHOOLS MAY NOT BE DOING ENOUGH TO MEET THEIR NEEDS TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE WHO NO LONGER IDENTIFY WITH THEIR SEX FROM BIRTH THEY FEEL THEY ARE REALLY MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX MANY OFTEN CHANGE THEIR NAME APPEARANCE AND EVEN UNDERGO MEDICAL TREATMENTS TO HELP MATCH OR KEEP UP WITH THE WAY THEY FEEL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION AMERICANS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS TRANSGENDER THAT NUMBER COMES FROM THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES' SCHOOL OF LAW EARLIER RESEARCH HAS SHOWN A GROWING NUMBER OF U S COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE REPORTED DEPRESSION ANXIETY OR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN RECENT YEARS THIS LATEST STUDY ATTEMPTS TO EXAMINE THE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS TRANSGENDER STUDENTS FACE THE FINDINGS WERE PUBLISHED LAST MONTH IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT INFORMATION FROM AN INTERNET BASED SURVEY CALLED THE HEALTHY MINDS STUDY IT INVOLVED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND ADULTS WHO STUDIED AT SEVENTY ONE U S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALL OF THEM WERE QUESTIONED ABOUT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH OUT OF THAT GROUP ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS REPORTED HAVING AN ALTERNATE GENDER IDENTITY MEANING THEY DO NOT IDENTIFY WITH THEIR BIRTH SEX THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT ALMOST EIGHTY PERCENT OF THOSE STUDENTS REPORTED DEALING WITH AT LEAST ONE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF CISGENDER STUDENTS THOSE WHO IDENTIFIED AS THEIR BIRTH SEX REPORTED HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE SARAH KETCHEN LIPSON IS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH SHE WAS ONE OF THE LEAD RESEARCHERS FOR THE HEALTHY MINDS STUDY SHE ALSO HELPED TO PREPARE THE REPORT ON TRANSGENDER STUDENTS LIPSON ARGUES ONE TROUBLING THING ABOUT THE FINDINGS IS NOT JUST THAT TRANSGENDER STUDENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO FACE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAN OTHER STUDENTS TRANSGENDER STUDENTS ALSO WERE MORE LIKELY TO FACE EVERY SINGLE KIND OF MENTAL ISSUE RAISED IN THE STUDY ESPECIALLY THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE AND ATTEMPTING SUICIDE THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THIS SHE SAYS SOME CAUSES OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS CAN AFFECT TRANSGENDER STUDENTS LONG BEFORE THEY EVER GO TO COLLEGE FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE HIGHER RATES OF FAMILY ABANDONMENT AND HOMELESSNESS NOTES LIPSON ONCE THEY DO ENTER COLLEGE TRANSGENDER STUDENTS STILL FACE DIFFICULTIES THAT MAY NOT BE AS CLEAR TO CISGENDER PEOPLE SHE SAYS MANY U S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE AT LEAST SOMEWHAT SUPPORTIVE OF GAY AND LESBIAN STUDENTS BUT THERE STILL BARRIERS TO TRANSGENDER STUDENTS FEELING FULLY ACCEPTED THIS INCLUDES THE FACT THAT MANY SCHOOLS FORCE STUDENTS TO USE THEIR BIRTH NAME OR GENDER PRONOUN AND MAKE CHANGING THIS INFORMATION ON SCHOOL RECORDS DIFFICULT RESTROOMS ARE MEANT ONLY TO BE USED BY PEOPLE OF A SPECIFIC SEX AND WHILE SCHOOLS MAY HAVE POLICIES TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GAY OR LESBIAN STUDENTS THEIR POLICIES OFTEN FAIL TO IDENTIFY TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS LIPSON SUGGESTS THAT ALL OF THESE SEEMINGLY MINOR ISSUES CAN INTENSIFY EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IF NOT CREATE NEW ONES THE REPORT'S FINDINGS DO NOT SURPRISE SHANE WINDEMEYER HE IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CAMPUS PRIDE ONE OF THE LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORTING LESBIAN GAY AND TRANSGENDER COLLEGE STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES WINDEMEYER NOTES WHILE MOST COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES EMPLOY TRAINED SPECIALISTS TO SUPPORT DIFFERENT MINORITY GROUPS THAT IS NOT THE CASE FOR TRANS STUDENTS TRANS FOLKS ARE NOT EVEN VISIBLE ON MANY COLLEGE CAMPUSES HE SAYS THEY ARE NOT SEEN AS A POPULATION TO SERVE STILL ON MANY CAMPUSES WINDEMEYER ADDS THAT DEALING WITH ALL OF THESE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES MAKES HIGHER EDUCATION SEEM MUCH HARDER FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS MAKE SUCCESS IN THEIR STUDIES THAT MUCH HARDER HE SAYS WHAT IS WORSE MOST SCHOOLS DO NOT EVEN GIVE STUDENTS THE CHOICE TO REPORT THEIR CHOSEN SEXUAL IDENTITY ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS SO ADMINISTRATORS HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW WELL OR HOW POORLY THEY ARE SERVING TRANSGENDER STUDENTS HE SAYS WINDEMEYER ARGUES THAT TO KNOW HOW TO BETTER HELP SUCH STUDENTS SCHOOL OFFICIALS MUST BE OPEN TO UNDERSTANDING THEIR NEEDS THIS COMES THROUGH A WILLINGNESS TO MAKE CHANGES WHEN NEEDED BUT HE AND LIPSON AGREE THAT IT ALSO COMES FROM BEING BETTER INFORMED SCHOOLS MUST EMPLOY PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS WHO UNDERSTAND THE

voa-47ddc840-c549-48d4-b429-556c3a6178183 IMAGINE YOU ARE ABOUT TO COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL AND ARE THINKING ABOUT ATTENDING A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH YOU FIND A SCHOOL YOU WOULD LIKE TO ATTEND BUT HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS SO YOU GO TO THE SCHOOL'S WEBSITE IN HOPES OF FINDING A FEW ANSWERS TIME GOES BY AND YOU STILL DO NOT HAVE THE ANSWERS YOU ALMOST FEEL LIKE GIVING UP BUT THEN A MESSAGE APPEARS ON YOUR COMPUTER OR PERSONAL ELECTRONIC DEVICE IT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE HOW CAN I HELP WRITING BACK TO THE WEBSITE YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN YOUR PROBLEM YOU POSSIBLY GET A FEW QUESTIONS IN RESPONSE TO CLARIFY WHAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE THEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE PERSON WITH WHOM YOU ARE IN CONTACT PROVIDES THE INFORMATION YOU ARE SEEKING EXCEPT YOU ARE NOT ACTUALLY COMMUNICATING WITH A SCHOOL OFFICIAL YOU ARE NOT EVEN DEALING WITH A HUMAN BEING YOU ARE IN CONTACT WITH A COMPUTER PROGRAM OR CHATBOT IT IS USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI FOR SHORT TO UNDERSTAND AND COMMUNICATE WITH YOU THIS MIGHT SOUND STRANGE BUT CHANCES ARE THIS WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH A COMPUTER PROGRAM WITHOUT KNOWING IT IN RECENT YEARS CHATBOTS HAVE BECOME A COMMON TOOL FOR BANKS AND LARGE COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVING HUMAN BEINGS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS AND COMPLAINTS CAN BE COSTLY REQUIRING MANY WORKERS AND IN MOST CASES EMPLOYEES CAN ONLY WORK A SET NUMBER OF HOURS IN A DAY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF TIME CUSTOMERS WAIT FOR A RESPONSE SO NOT JUST COMPANIES BUT A GROWING NUMBER OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE ALSO BEGUN USING CHATBOT TECHNOLOGY SAYS KEITH RAJECKI HE IS WITH ORACLE HIGHER EDUCATION A COMPUTER SOFTWARE COMPANY THAT SERVES THESE INSTITUTIONS ORACLE OFFERS SEVERAL SOFTWARE TOOLS NOW IN USE AT HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THESE TOOLS HELP WITH ALMOST EVERYTHING FROM ACADEMIC RECORD KEEPING TO EMPLOYEE SERVICES AND MOST INCLUDE A CHATBOT IN THEIR PROGRAMMING RAJECKI NOTES THAT REDUCING COSTS AND RESPONSE TIMES IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS SCHOOLS AND COMPANIES ARE TURNING TO THIS TECHNOLOGY HOWEVER THE GOAL OF MANY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IS TO FIND WAYS TO BETTER SERVE STUDENTS PART OF THAT RELATES TO THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT GENERATION OF COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE USED TO COMMUNICATING ONLINE SAID RAJECKI THEY ALREADY TALK WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGING SERVICE LIKE FACEBOOK AND WECHAT BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY HE SAID STUDENTS WANT SUPPORT OUTSIDE OF THE HOURS WHEN IT IS NORMALLY AVAILABLE YES TRADITIONAL STUDENTS ARE IN THE CLASS AT SET HOURS BUT THE REALITY IS A LOT OF THE WORK THAT THEY DO AND CONTINUED INTERACTION WITH THE INSTITUTION TAKES PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM ONLINE DAY AND NIGHT RAJECKI TOLD VOA AUSTRALIA'S UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE NOTED MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN ITS SERVICE TO STUDENTS AFTER DEPLOYING AN ORACLE CHATBOT TO DEAL WITH ADMISSIONS QUESTIONS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT SAID THAT STUDENTS RECEIVED RESPONSES THIRTEEN TIMES FASTER AND STUDENTS' APPROVAL OF THE QUALITY OF SERVICE INCREASED BY SIXTY PERCENT NOW ORACLE IS OFFERING ONE PROGRAM FOR ALL AREAS OF SUPPORT SERVICES THAT COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES PROVIDE TO THEIR STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES THIS INCLUDES A CHATBOT THAT CAN DO EVERYTHING FROM HELPING STUDENTS REGISTER FOR CLASSES TO HELPING PROFESSORS REQUEST TIME OFF ORACLE IS NOT THE ONLY COMPANY WORKING ON THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY BUSINESSES LIKE ADMITHUB AND IVY AI ARE INVOLVED IN SIMILAR EFFORTS SEVERAL SCHOOLS HAVE ALSO CREATED THEIR OWN SYSTEMS WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY OR WGU OPERATES COMPLETELY ONLINE MEANING IT HAS NO ACTUAL GROUNDS OR PHYSICAL CAMPUS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE SCHOOL'S NON PROFIT RESEARCH AGENCY WGU LABS RECEIVED A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR AWARD FROM THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION TO EXPERIMENT WITH A NEW KIND OF CHATBOT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CREATE A BOT THAT ANSWERS SIMPLE QUESTIONS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SAID JASON LEVEN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WGU LABS WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO CREATE AN AGENT THAT CAN HELP DECISION MAKING FOR STUDENTS LIKE ORACLE WGU'S CHATBOT SOFTWARE WILL USE MACHINE LEARNING TO STUDY PAST INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STUDENTS AND OTHER CHATBOTS LEVEN SAID THIS WILL ENABLE THE PROGRAM'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO CONTINUOUSLY LEARN AND IMPROVE ITS COMMUNICATION SKILLS BUT ADDITIONALLY HE NOTED THE GOAL IS TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHOOL'S STUDENTS THIS INCLUDES EXPECTATIONS ON HOW MUCH TIME THEY CAN COMMIT TO THEIR STUDIES HOW LONG THEY THINK A STUDY PROGRAM SHOULD TAKE TO COMPLETE AND WHAT KIND OF CAREER THEY WANT THEN WHEN A STUDENT WHO IS UNSURE OF THE PROGRAM OR FIELD OF STUDY THEY ARE INTERESTED IN VISITS THE WGU WEBSITE THEY CAN INTERACT WITH THE CHATBOT THIS CHATBOT CAN THEN HELP THE STUDENT FIND THE PROGRAM THAT BEST MEETS THEIR NEEDS IT MAY EVEN SUGGEST THEY ARE TOO BUSY TO SEEK HIGHER EDUCATION AT THAT TIME TO ENSURE THEY DO NOT TRY AND FAIL SAID LEVIN HOWEVER NOT EVERYONE IS READY TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITIES THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY PRESENTS IAN JACOBS IS WITH THE MARKET RESEARCH COMPANY FORRESTER HE SUGGESTS THAT TECHNOLOGY LIKE CHATBOTS CAN WORK WELL IF IT IS ABLE TO DO WHAT USERS ASK OF IT JACOBS SAYS THE PROBLEM IS WHEN COST CUTTING BECOMES AN IMPORTANT REASON FOR DEPLOYING THE TECHNOLOGY THIS MEANS SCHOOLS AND COMPANIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO TRY USING CHATBOTS FOR THINGS THEY ARE NOT YET ABLE TO DO AI PROGRAMS ARE NOT YET ABLE TO FULLY INTERACT IN THE WAY HUMANS DO HE NOTES FOR ONE THING THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF WAYS TO WORD EVEN SIMPLE REQUESTS WHEN CHATBOTS MAKE MISTAKES IN ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT SITUATIONS THIS CAN RESULT IN REALLY PROBLEMATIC USER EXPERIENCES WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PARENT DIES AND THE STUDENT HAS TO RENEGOTIATE FINANCIAL AID THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO AUTOMATE THAT AND I THINK RIGHT NOW HIGHER EDUCATION IS NOT REALLY GOOD AT FIGURING OUT WHERE HUMAN BEINGS NEED TO BE INVOLVED SAID JACOBS I'M DOROTHY GUNDY AND I'M PETE MUSTO

voa-4e2acb94-f336-46ae-a187-bdf5765ac02c3 HAVE YOU EVER RECORDED YOURSELF ON AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE WHILE SPEAKING ENGLISH IF SO WHAT KINDS OF THINGS DID YOU NOTICE RECORDING YOURSELF GIVES YOU THE CHANCE TO LISTEN TO AND CRITIQUE YOUR ENGLISH SPEAKING SKILLS YOU CAN TAKE NOTE OF THINGS LIKE SENTENCE STRUCTURE WORD CHOICE PRONUNCIATION AND FLUENCY THIS CAN GIVE YOU A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT YOUR STRENGTHS ARE AND WHICH AREAS NEED MORE WORK TODAY ON EDUCATION TIPS WE WILL TALK ABOUT TWO RECORDING ACTIVITIES YOU CAN DO TO STRENGTHEN YOUR SPEAKING SKILLS THE FIRST ACTIVITY INVOLVES NARRATIVE STORYTELLING WILLIAM STOUT TEACHES AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY IN WASHINGTON D C HIS SPECIALTY IS TEACHING ENGLISH AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE HE SAYS SOME SPEAKING ACTIVITIES DO NOT GIVE AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF YOUR TRUE LANGUAGE SKILLS BUT NARRATIVE STORYTELLING DOES NARRATIVE STORYTELLING IS THE RETELLING OF A STORY IT CAN BE A SHORT PIECE OF FICTION SUCH AS A PROGRAM FROM THE VOA LEARNING ENGLISH SERIES AMERICAN STORIES OR IT CAN BE THE RETELLING OF A NEWS EVENT OR YOU CAN TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN YOUR OWN LIFE STOUT EXPLAINS THAT NARRATIVE STORYTELLING FREES YOUR MIND FROM FORMING COMPLEX IDEAS WHICH LETS YOU SPEAK MORE EASILY IN ENGLISH ON THE OTHER HAND HE NOTES AN ACTIVITY REQUIRING YOUR OPINION CAN SLOW YOU DOWN THAT IS BECAUSE IT FORCES YOU TO THINK ABOUT YOUR IDEAS AS YOU SAY THEM FOR THE NARRATIVE STORYTELLING ACTIVITY STOUT SAYS TRY TO PROVIDE AS MANY DETAILS AS POSSIBLE AND AIM FOR A RECORDING OF THREE MINUTES OR FEWER DON'T JUST SAY 'I STUDIED AT THE LIBRARY ' SAY 'I WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY AND I THOUGHT ABOUT WHERE I SHOULD SIT AND MOST OF THE SEATS WERE TAKEN SO I LOOKED AROUND AND I FINALLY FOUND A SPOT BUT IT WAS NEAR THE WINDOW BUT IT WAS CHILLY SO I HAD TO KEEP MY COAT ON ' SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE GOAL IN GIVING SUCH DETAIL IS NOT TO FILL THE TIME BUT TO SPEAK AT A FASTER SPEED BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO STOP AND THINK OF EACH IDEA SEPARATELY BEFORE THE ACTIVITY STOUT SUGGESTS SPEAKING OUT LOUD TO YOURSELF A FEW TIMES TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR MAIN POINTS IN MIND WHEN LISTENING TO THE RECORDING DO NOT EXPECT TO FIND ALL OR EVEN MOST GRAMMAR OR VOCABULARY MISTAKES HE SAYS BUT YOU CAN EASILY FIND SOME MISTAKES SUCH AS WRONG VERB TENSES VERB ENDINGS AND NOUN ENDINGS YOU CAN ALSO TAKE NOTE OF YOUR LANGUAGE FLUENCY OTHER THINGS ARE HARDER TO DO YOURSELF LIKE RECOGNIZING AND CRITIQUING INDIVIDUAL SOUNDS FROM WORDS AFTER THE FIRST RECORDING STOUT SAYS RECORD YOURSELF TELLING THE SAME STORY AT LEAST ONCE MORE AND TAKE NOTE OF YOUR PROGRESS BUT AVOID MEMORIZING YOUR SPEECH THE SECOND ACTIVITY INVOLVES GIVING AND GETTING DIRECTIONS WYNTER OSHIBERU TEACHES ENGLISH IN THE WASHINGTON D C AREA SHE WORKS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR LANGUAGE STUDIES AND MONTGOMERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE SHE IS ALSO A VOLUNTEER ENGLISH TEACHER FOR A NONPROFIT GROUP CALLED PAPER AIRPLANES OSHIBERU SAYS GIVING DIRECTIONS IS A REAL WORLD SKILL AND ONE YOU CAN USE ALMOST ANYWHERE AND YOU CAN TRAIN BY YOURSELF IF YOU DO NOT HAVE PEOPLE TO SPEAK ENGLISH WITH THE FIRST STEP IN THE ACTIVITY IS TO CHOOSE A STARTING POINT AND A DESTINATION FOR THE STARTING POINT SHE SAYS CHOOSE A PLACE THAT YOU KNOW WELL LIKE YOUR HOME OR A NEARBY BUS OR TRAIN STATION FOR THE DESTINATION CHOOSE A PLACE YOU NEED TO TRAVEL TO MORE OFTEN SUCH AS THE SUPERMARKET TRAIN STATION YOUR WORK PLACE OR FAVORITE EATING PLACE THEN RECORD YOURSELF GIVING THE DIRECTIONS THE RECORDING SHOULD NOT BE LONGER THAN ONE MINUTE OSHIBERU SAYS THE ACTIVITY IS A GOOD WAY TO EMPLOY THE IMPERATIVE FORM ALSO KNOWN AS THE COMMAND FORM IN ENGLISH THE COMMAND FORM BEGINS WITH A VERB AS IN TURN RIGHT WHEN YOU REACH THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE NOTE HOWEVER THAT WHEN GIVING DIRECTIONS NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS SOMETIMES ADD THE SUBJECT YOU TO THE START OF A COMMAND THE CORRECT WAY IF YOU'RE TELLING SOMEONE WHAT TO DO YOU MIGHT WANT TO START OFF WITH 'FIRST YOU GO RIGHT ON SEVENTH STREET' OR 'FIRST YOU TURN RIGHT ON SEVENTH STREET' OR JUST 'TURN RIGHT ON SEVENTH STREET ' AVOID ADDING THE MODAL VERB CAN WHICH OSHIBERU NOTES IS A COMMON MISTAKE OF ENGLISH LEARNERS FOR EXAMPLE AVOID SAYING SOMETHING LIKE YOU CAN TURN RIGHT ON SEVENTH STREET WHEN LISTENING TO YOUR RECORDING TAKE NOTE OF YOUR SUBJECT VERB AGREEMENT USE OF PREPOSITIONS USE OF THE COMMAND FORM AND PRONUNCIATION YOU CAN EVEN TRY USING YOUR OWN DIRECTIONS YOURSELF OSHIBERU ADDS IN OTHER WORDS PLAY THE RECORDING AS YOU WALK FROM THE STARTING POINT TO THE DESTINATION THIS WILL LET YOU KNOW WHETHER YOUR DIRECTIONS WERE CLEAR AND ACCURATE ANOTHER WAY TO PRACTICE GETTING DIRECTIONS IS TO USE YOUR PHONE'S GPS OR GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM TO DO THIS SHE SUGGESTS CHANGING THE LANGUAGE SETTINGS ON THE GPS SYSTEM TO ENGLISH THEN CHOOSE A DESTINATION TO GET WALKING DIRECTIONS TO A PLACE THAT IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY SET THE GPS SO YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE DIRECTIONS AND THEN FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TO THE DESTINATION OSHIBERU SAYS LISTENING TO DIRECTIONS IS USEFUL BECAUSE WHEN YOU GIVE DIRECTIONS TO A REAL PERSON THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT BRINGS OUR PROGRAM TO A CLOSE AS YOU TRY THESE SPEAKING ACTIVITIES REMEMBER TO RELAX AND ENJOY THE PROCESS AND DON'T FORGET TO CELEBRATE THE THINGS YOU DO WELL LET US KNOW HOW IT GOES I'M ALICE BRYANT

TAKE A CORONAVIRUS TEST EVERY OTHER DAY FOR TWO WEEKS AND THEN TWO TESTS A WEEK AFTER THAT THE COLLEGE SAYS IT WILL PROVIDE UP TO EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND TESTS OVER THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS THAT IS NEARLY AS MANY AS THE ENTIRE STATE OF MAINE HAS PROVIDED SINCE THE HEALTH CRISIS STARTED COLBY IS A PRIVATE COLLEGE OF TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS IT JOINS A GROWING NUMBER OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES ANNOUNCING AGGRESSIVE TESTING PLANS TO IDENTIFY COVID NINETEEN CASES BEFORE THEY SPREAD HARVARD UNIVERSITY SAYS ALL STUDENTS LIVING ON ITS CAMPUS WILL BE TESTED WHEN THEY ARRIVE AND THEN THREE TIMES A WEEK BOSTON UNIVERSITY PLANS TO TEST MOST STUDENTS AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK BUT WHETHER SCHOOLS SHOULD BE TESTING EVERY STUDENT '' AND WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO '' IS A SUBJECT OF DEBATE SOME COLLEGES PLAN TO TEST STUDENTS ONLY IF THEY SHOW SIGNS OF THE VIRUS OR COME IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS TESTED POSITIVE BUT SOME RESEARCHERS SAY THAT PLAN COULD QUICKLY LEAD TO INFECTIONS CAUSED BY STUDENTS WHO SHOW NO SIGNS OF THE DISEASE AS UNIVERSITIES HURRY TO MAKE PLANS FOR VIRUS TESTING U S FEDERAL OFFICIALS ARE WARNING THAT THEY COULD OVERLOAD LABORATORIES THAT PROCESS TESTS FOR HOSPITALS IN A CALL WITH GOVERNORS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY ALEX AZAR SAID TOO MANY COLLEGES ARE AGREEING TO DEALS WITH PRIVATE LABORATORIES THIS THREATENS TO JAM UP THE SYSTEM HE SAID INSTEAD AZAR SAID COLLEGES SHOULD DEVELOP TESTING OPERATIONS IN THEIR OWN LABORATORIES ESPECIALLY AT BIG RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES COLLEGE OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN

TERP IS VICE PRESIDENT FOR ADMINISTRATION AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AT COLBY COLLEGE HE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT COLBY'S TESTING PLAN WILL COST AN ESTIMATED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST TO PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT BUT TRUTHFULLY IT'S ALSO TO GIVE ALL OF US COMFORT TO GIVE OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COMFORT AND TO GIVE OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES COMFORT TERP SAID BUT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA IN CHAPEL HILL OFFICIALS QUESTION THE VALUE OF SUCH A PLAN THEY ARGUE THAT TESTING EVERY STUDENT COULD CREATE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY INSTEAD THE UNIVERSITY PLANS TO TEST STUDENTS WHO SHOW SIGNS OF THE CORONAVIRUS OR COME INTO CONTACT WITH IT AND THOSE IN HIGH RISK GROUPS VIRUS TESTING IS JUST ONE OF MANY SAFETY MEASURES COLLEGES ARE PLANNING AS THEY LOOK TO REOPEN MANY PLAN TO REDUCE CLASS SIZES LIMIT THE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS LIVING IN ON CAMPUS HOUSING REQUIRE FACE COVERINGS AND BAN LARGE GATHERINGS BY TESTING COLLEGES HOPE TO IDENTIFY SICK STUDENTS AND SEPARATE THEM FROM HEALTHY ONES TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS FOR MONTHS COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LEADERS HAVE ARGUED THAT TESTING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO A SAFE REOPENING NEXT MONTH BUT WITH LIMITED GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL OFFICIALS COLLEGES HAVE CREATED A MIX OF PLANS BASED ON ADVICE FROM STATE AGENCIES AND ON RESEARCH FROM THEIR OWN HEALTH EXPERTS THE TEXAS A AND M UNIVERSITY SYSTEM RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL DIVIDE FIFTEEN THOUSAND TESTS AMONG ITS CAMPUSES EACH MONTH THE TESTS WILL ONLY BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO SHOW SYMPTOMS OR COME INTO CONTACT WITH KNOWN CASES HARVEY MUDD COLLEGE NEAR LOS ANGELES AND MACALESTER COLLEGE IN MINNESOTA HAVE SIMILAR PLANS SOME UNIVERSITIES PLAN TO TEST STUDENTS WHEN THEY ARRIVE BUT AFTER THOSE TESTS THEY PLAN TO TARGET STUDENTS WITH SYMPTOMS OTHER SCHOOLS SAY THEY WILL TEST RANDOM SAMPLES OF STUDENTS WHILE SOME PLAN TO TEST ALL STUDENTS AT SOME POINT IN TIME THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION OR CDC URGES AGAINST WIDESPREAD TESTING IT SAYS COLLEGES SHOULD MAINLY TEST STUDENTS WITH SYMPTOMS THE CDC SAYS BROADER TESTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY IN AREAS WITH HIGHER VIRUS TRANSMISSION RATES BUT RESEARCHERS WARN THAT DEPENDING ON SYMPTOMS ALONE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH THEY SAY MANY YOUNG PEOPLE CARRY THE VIRUS BUT NEVER FEEL SICK WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THOSE CASES THEY SAY THE VIRUS COULD QUICKLY SPREAD OUT OF CONTROL RECENTLY A CORNELL UNIVERSITY RESEARCH TEAM FOUND THAT STUDENTS WOULD NEED TO BE TESTED EVERY SEVEN DAYS TO KEEP INFECTIONS DOWN A SEPARATE STUDY FROM YALE UNIVERSITY AND THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL SUGGESTED THAT TESTING ONLY ONCE A WEEK COULD LEAD TO THOUSANDS OF INFECTIONS OVER A COLLEGE TERM THE RISK THAT STUDENTS COULD ARRIVE ON CAMPUS CARRYING THE VIRUS WITHOUT KNOWING IT IS OF SPECIAL CONCERN TO COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS SOME ARE ASKING STUDENTS TO GET TESTED BEFORE THEY ARRIVE ITHACA COLLEGE IN NEW YORK RECENTLY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO BAR STUDENTS FROM MORE THAN TWENTY

voa-555af190-5ecf-4fdd-96da-44257175f6db3 FOR BRYANT ATENCIA THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF HIS STUDENTS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS LESSON PLANS THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN LAGUNA PROVINCE IN THE PHILIPPINES WHERE HE TEACHES HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE ALSO FACING WHAT HE CALLS A HUGE ADJUSTMENT TO DISTANCE LEARNING ATENCIA TOLD VOA THAT BEFORE THE HEALTH CRISIS STARTED HE MAINLY TAUGHT FROM BOOKS AND GAVE TESTS ON THE MATERIAL BUT NOW I TRY TO TOUCH THE EMOTION TOUCH BASE WITH THE STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS I TRY TO BUILD UP THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WOULD MAKE THE STUDENTS MORE COMFORTABLE IN TAKING LESSONS ONLINE RIGHT NOW TEACHERS AROUND THE WORLD ARE AMENDING THEIR LESSON PLANS FOR ONLINE LEARNING SO TEACHING SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SKILLS OR SEL MAY NOT BE HIGH ON THEIR TO DO LIST YET SOME EXPERTS SAY THESE SKILLS ARE MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER CHRISTINA CIPRIANO IS DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT THE YALE CENTER FOR EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AT YALE UNIVERSITY IN CONNECTICUT IN AN OPEN LETTER TO TEACHERS AFTER SCHOOLS CLOSED IN MARCH SHE WROTE NOW IS WHEN WE NEED TO APPLY EVERYTHING WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT SEL SHE ADDED THAT THESE ARE REAL SKILLS THAT CAN SUPPORT US IN MANAGING THE ROLLERCOASTER OF EMOTIONS WE WILL BE HAVING OVER THE COMING DAYS AND MONTHS ATENCIA WHO ALSO TRAINS TEACHERS AND TEACHES ENGLISH AT ANOTHER JOB WAS READY FOR WHATEVER CAME IN MAY HE TOOK ONLINE TRAININGS ON SEL AND HOW TO USE IT IN THE CLASSROOM ONE MONTH BEFORE HIS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS BEGAN CLASSES HE HELD WEEKLY ZOOM VIDEO CONFERENCE MEETINGS WITH THEM HIS GOALS WERE GETTING STUDENTS EXCITED ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING AND IDENTIFYING THEIR SKILLS AND NEEDS IN ONE MEETING ATENCIA PUT THE STUDENTS INTO THREE SEPARATE ONLINE ROOMS AND GAVE THEM A CREATIVE ACTIVITY HE WANTED TO SEE HOW WELL THEY WORKED INDEPENDENTLY AND IN GROUPS AND WHICH ONES WOULD NEED THE MOST SUPPORT GOING FORWARD THE COLLABORATIVE FOR ACADEMIC SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING OR CASEL IS A RESEARCH AND TRAINING ORGANIZATION IT DIVIDES SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SKILLS INTO FIVE AREAS THEY ARE RECOGNIZING AND CONTROLLING ONE'S EMOTIONS SETTING AND REACHING POSITIVE GOALS SHOWING SYMPATHY FOR OTHER PEOPLE DEVELOPING AND KEEPING POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS AND MAKING RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS THE YALE CENTER'S RESEARCH FOUND THAT EMOTIONS LIKE HAPPINESS AND CURIOSITY SUPPORT A PERSON'S ABILITY TO PAY ATTENTION AND HAVE GREATER INVOLVEMENT IN SCHOOL BUT EMOTIONS LIKE ANXIETY AND FEAR ESPECIALLY OVER LONG PERIODS HURT ONE'S ABILITY TO THINK CLEARLY AILEEN WATTS HAS WITNESSED THIS KIND OF ANXIETY IN STUDENTS FIRSTHAND IN HER TWENTY YEARS OF TEACHING SHE HAS WORKED WITH STUDENTS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE INCLUDING THOSE WHO WERE HOMELESS AND THOSE REQUIRING SPECIAL EDUCATION SHE HAS ALSO TAUGHT IRAQI CHILDREN LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES WATTS SAYS THAT OVER THE YEARS SHE HAS OFTEN INCLUDED SOME FORM OF SEL IN HER LESSONS LAST YEAR SHE TAUGHT SIXTH GRADERS AT A SCHOOL IN MCLEAN VIRGINIA SOME OF THE STUDENTS WERE BORN IN IRAQ AND HAD SEEN FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS KILLED WATTS SAID SHE AND OTHER TEACHERS BUILT IN ACTIVITIES TO HELP STUDENTS REDUCE ANXIETY CLASSES TOOK BRAIN BREAKS WHICH MEANT STOPPING THE LESSON TO PLAY A SHORT GAME OR EVEN DO A DANCE AND IF A CHILD WAS FEELING ANXIOUS HE OR SHE COULD PARTNER WITH SOMEONE TO HELP CALM THOSE EMOTIONS WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT IF THEY'RE STRESSED OUT THEY DON'T TAKE IN NEW INFORMATION THEY DON'T PARTICIPATE WATTS WHO IS BASED IN ARKANSAS HAS JUST BEGUN TEACHING FIFTH GRADERS ONLINE AT FORT BELVOIR A U S ARMY BASE IN VIRGINIA SHE SAID MOST OF THE SEL ACTIVITIES ARE BUILT INTO THE FIRST PART OF THE DAY AND INVOLVE RELATIONSHIP BUILDING DEALING WITH SOCIAL PRESSURE AND RECOGNIZING ONE'S STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES A RECENT STUDY OF TEENAGERS FOUND THAT MANY STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND SADNESS DURING THE MASS SCHOOL CLOSURES SIX MONTHS AGO AROUND FORTY PERCENT SAID THEY HAD NOT BEEN OFFERED ANY SOCIAL OR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT BY AN ADULT FROM THEIR SCHOOL WATTS TOLD VOA THAT IN ADDITION TO PANDEMIC RELATED STRESS SPENDING SIX HOURS IN AN ONLINE CLASS DAILY CAUSES CHILDREN MORE STRESS SO SHE SAYS EDUCATORS IN FAIRFAX COUNTY VIRGINIA ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER DE STRESSING ACTIVITIES STUDENTS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES FACING INCREASED ANXIETY AND STRESS BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH CRISIS AFTER THE PANDEMIC BEGAN THE YALE CENTER FOR EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE PARTNERED WITH CASEL ON A QUESTIONNAIRE FOR TEACHERS WITHIN THREE DAYS MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND RESPONDED SAYING THEY MOST OFTEN FELT FIVE EMOTIONS ANXIOUS FEARFUL WORRIED OVERCOME AND SAD SOME TEACHERS FEARED THAT THEY OR A FAMILY MEMBER WOULD GET COVID NINETEEN ANOTHER CAUSE OF STRESS WAS HAVING TO DEAL WITH THEIR OWN NEEDS AND THEIR FAMILIES' NEEDS WHILE WORKING FULL TIME FROM HOME AND THERE WAS ANXIETY AROUND USING NEW TEACHING TECHNOLOGIES WATTS NOTED THAT THE HEAD OF ONE ARKANSAS SCHOOL ASKED ITS COUNSELORS TO CREATE DE STRESSING ACTIVITIES FOR THE TEACHERS THERE THE TEACHERS WERE FACING INCREASED PRESSURE FROM PROBLEMS INVOLVING THE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SOME HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE LOST JOBS DURING THE PANDEMIC

voa-6666263a-cd43-45c4-af03-13e8e0f66be43 EVEN BEFORE THE COVID NINETEEN HEALTH CRISIS MANY AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES STARTED TO RECONSIDER THE VALUE OF TESTS LIKE THE SAT AND ACT STANDARDIZED TESTS HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR MANY YEARS SOME EDUCATION EXPERTS ARGUE THAT THEY ONLY SHOW HOW WELL A STUDENT TAKES TESTS INSTEAD OF HOW MUCH THEY HAVE LEARNED INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND STUDENTS WHO DID NOT GROW UP SPEAKING ENGLISH HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THESE TESTS IN THE PAST BECAUSE OF THIS SOME UNIVERSITIES ENDED THEIR TEST REQUIREMENT RESEARCH FROM THE COMPANY THAT CREATES ONE OF THESE TESTS ACT INCORPORATED SHOWS THAT THE NUMBER OF TEST OPTIONAL SCHOOLS INCREASED BY TWO HUNDRED TO OVER NINE HUNDRED FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN BUT WHEN LARGE GROUP ACTIVITIES SUCH AS TESTING EVENTS FOR STUDENTS WERE CANCELED IN TWENTY TWENTY EVEN MORE COLLEGES BECAME TEST OPTIONAL THIS MEANS THEY DO NOT REQUIRE BUT WILL STILL ACCEPT STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES IN STUDENTS' APPLICATIONS AS A RESULT MANY COLLEGES THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE IN THEIR ADMISSIONS POLICIES RECEIVED MORE APPLICANTS THAN USUAL A RECENT STORY IN THE WASHINGTON POST NEWSPAPER SAID THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY KNOWN AS MIT HAD SIXTY SIX PERCENT MORE APPLICANTS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAN IT DID IN TWENTY TWENTY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES UCLA RECEIVED TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT MORE THE RESEARCH BY ACT INCORPORATED SHOWED THAT MANY SCHOOLS WILL CONTINUE THEIR TEST OPTIONAL POLICY AFTER THE CORONAVIRUS HEALTH CRISIS ENDS ERIC HOOVER WRITES ABOUT COLLEGE ADMISSIONS FOR THE CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION HE SAID COLLEGES WILL CONTINUE TO CONSIDER TEST SCORES BUT TEST OPTIONAL POLICIES SHOULD HELP STUDENTS WHO STRUGGLE WITH TESTS IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LOVE TAKING TESTS AND YOU FEEL LIKE TESTS ARE NOT THE BEST REPRESENTATION OF WHO YOU ARE AS A STUDENT AND WHAT YOUR POTENTIAL IS THEN I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE WORLD'S GETTING A LITTLE KINDER AND GENTLER FOR THE MANY MANY GREAT STUDENTS WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON JUST DON'T FARE AS WELL ON THE ACT OR THE SAT THOSE KIND OF STANDARDIZED TESTS EARLIER THIS YEAR VOA SPOKE WITH KIDIST BEKELE A STUDENT FROM ANNANDALE HIGH SCHOOL IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA SHE WAS BORN IN ERITREA AND ONLY RECENTLY CAME TO THE U S VOA SPOKE TO HER AGAIN TO ASK ABOUT TEST OPTIONAL APPLICATIONS BEKELE SAID SHE HAD TAKEN THE SAT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND WAS NOT HAPPY WITH HER SCORE OF ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY OUT OF A POSSIBLE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SHE WAS PLANNING TO TAKE THE TEST AGAIN BUT IT WAS CANCELED SHE WAS GLAD THAT COLLEGES CONSIDERED HER WHOLE RECORD AND DID NOT DISQUALIFY HER BECAUSE HER SCORE WAS LOWER THAN SHE HOPED I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY GOOD WITH SCHOOL HAVE A GOOD GPA BUT STILL DON'T DO GOOD ON THE ACT I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT USING TIME AND TEST TAKING SKILLS SHE WAS ACCEPTED TO A NUMBER OF UNIVERSITIES AND IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN WASHINGTON D C VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY AND VIRGINIA TECH ALL THREE SCHOOLS WERE TEST OPTIONAL AND SHE DID NOT SEND HER SCORE BEKELE SAID SHE MOVED OUT OF ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE CLASSES TWO YEARS AGO BUT SHE STILL HAD TROUBLE WITH SOME OF THE READING PARTS OF THE TESTS THE WRITING WAS EASIER THAN THE READING BUT THE READING WAS VERY HARD SHE SAID FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME IT'S NOT A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF WHAT PEOPLE DO IN SCHOOL HOOVER THE EDUCATION WRITER NOTED THAT UNIVERSITIES USE TEST SCORES FOR REASONS OTHER THAN DECIDING WHO GETS IN THEY USE THEM AS A WAY TO FIND OUT WHICH STUDENTS TO RECRUIT AND AS A WAY TO DECIDE TO WHOM THEY MIGHT OFFER FINANCIAL AID BEKELE SAID SHE UNDERSTANDS TEST OPTIONAL SCHOOLS MAY STILL USE TEST SCORES TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN ONE STUDENT WHO SUBMITTED A SCORE AND ONE WHO DID NOT THEY MIGHT CHOOSE THAT STUDENT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A TEST OPTIONAL SCHOOL IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE RECOGNIZED SHE SAID ZOE COYLE IS FROM CLEVELAND OHIO SHE WILL START HER FIRST YEAR AT TUFTS UNIVERSITY IN BOSTON MASSACHUSETTS IN THE AUTUMN TUFTS WAS TEST OPTIONAL BUT SHE STILL SENT HER SCORES HER HIGH SCHOOL'S ADVISOR TOLD STUDENTS TO DO THAT IF WE DIDN'T SHE SAID THEN IT WOULD BE TELLING THE SCHOOL THAT WE WERE BELOW AVERAGE SHE SAID TEST OPTIONAL ADMISSIONS GIVE STUDENTS WHO ARE OUTSTANDING AT SOMETHING OTHER THAN ACADEMICS THE CONFIDENCE TO SEND APPLICATIONS SHE SPOKE ABOUT HER FRIENDS WHO WANTED TO STUDY MUSIC AND THEATER IN COLLEGE THEY CHOSE NOT TO SEND THEIR SCORES COYLE SAID SHE SEES HOW TEST SCORES CAN HELP COLLEGES CHOOSE STUDENTS BUT SHE IS PLEASED THAT THEY ARE MAKING SCORES LESS IMPORTANT IT DOES FEEL LIKE NOTES FROM TEACHERS AND PERSONAL ESSAYS ARE WAY MORE IMPORTANT AND IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE COLLEGES ARE LEANING INTO THAT MORE AND FOR SOME COLLEGES COVID KIND OF GAVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE BIGGER STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION WHICH I GUESS IS ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF COVID ACT INCORPORATED SAID ABOUT THIRTY

REPAIR BUSINESS AND A USED COMPUTER BUSINESS IN THAT BUILDING A MAN DEALS DAILY WITH LIFE AND DEATH SETH VIDDAL AND HIS EMPLOYEES HAVE BUILT A BURIAL CONTAINER OR VESSEL RECENTLY THEY TOLD REPORTERS FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT THEY HOPE THIS VESSEL WILL BE THE START OF A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TYPE OF BURIAL SCIENCE THIS PROCESS WILL INCLUDE THE NATURAL BREAKDOWN OF THE HUMAN BODY THOSE IN THE BURIAL BUSINESS CALL THIS BODY COMPOSTING IT IS A NATURAL PROCESS WHERE THE BODY IS RETURNED TO AN ELEMENTAL LEVEL OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SAID VIDDAL HE SAID IT IS SIMILAR TO COMPOSTING OF FOOD AND YARD WASTE THIS IS THE SAME PROCESS BUT DONE WITH A HUMAN BODY INSIDE OF A VESSEL AND IN OUR CASE IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT ON SEPTEMBER SEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE COLORADO BECAME THE SECOND STATE AFTER WASHINGTON TO PERMIT HUMAN BODY COMPOSTING OREGON WILL PERMIT THE PRACTICE BEGINNING NEXT JULY IN WASHINGTON STATE THERE ARE THREE BUSINESSES LICENSED TO COMPOST HUMAN REMAINS TOGETHER THEY HAVE COMPOSTED AT LEAST EIGHTY FIVE BODIES SINCE THE LAW TOOK EFFECT IN MAY TWENTY TWENTY MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED UP FOR THIS SERVICE AS NATURAL FUNERALS BECOME MORE POPULAR VIDDAL CO OWNS THE NATURAL FUNERAL IN LAFAYETTE COLORADO SOON AFTER THE COLORADO LEGISLATION WAS SIGNED INTO LAW HE STARTED BUILDING THE VESSEL IN AN INDUSTRIAL PART OF TOWN THE VESSEL IS ABOUT TWO METERS LONG ABOUT ONE METER WIDE AND ABOUT ONE METER DEEP THE BOX IS LINED WITH WATERPROOF MATERIAL AND PACKED WITH WOOD CHIPS AND STRAW TWO LARGE WHEELS ON EITHER END ALLOW IT TO BE ROLLED ACROSS THE FLOOR THIS PROVIDES THE AIR AND MOVEMENT NEEDED FOR A BODY TO COMPOST THE VESSEL MUST REACH FIFTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS FOR SEVENTY TWO CONTINUOUS HOURS TO KILL ANY BACTERIA AND GERMS TEETH ARE REMOVED TO PREVENT POISONING FROM CHEMICALS USED IN TEETH REPAIR THEN AFTER ABOUT THREE MONTHS THE VESSEL IS OPENED AND THE SOIL IS EXAMINED FOR MEDICAL DEVICES THE REMAINING LARGE BONES ARE RETURNED TO THE VESSEL FOR ANOTHER THREE MONTHS OF COMPOSTING IN SIX MONTHS THE BODY WOOD CHIPS AND STRAW WILL TURN INTO SOIL FAMILY MEMBERS CAN KEEP THE SOIL TO USE IN THEIR YARDS HOWEVER COLORADO LAW FORBIDS SELLING IT AND USING IT TO GROW FOOD FOR HUMAN USE ALSO THE STATE ONLY PERMITS LICENSED FUNERAL HOMES AND CREMATORIES TO COMPOST HUMAN BODIES VIDDAL CALLS THE PROCESS AN EXCITING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY CHOICE HE ADDED THAT IN DEATH HE ALSO SEES LIFE COMPOSTING ITSELF IS A VERY LIVING FUNCTION AND IT IS PERFORMED BY LIVING ORGANISMS HE TOLD REPORTERS HE ADDED THAT THERE ARE BILLIONS OF MICROBES IN OUR BODIES AND WHEN LIFE ENDS THE LIFE OF THOSE MICROBES CONTINUES VIDDAL SAID BODY COMPOSTING SUCCESSFULLY TURNS THE BODY BACK INTO SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE EARTH HOWEVER NOT EVERYONE APPROVES OF BODY COMPOSTING THE COLORADO CATHOLIC CONFERENCE IS A GROUP OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHO AIM TO SHAPE PUBLIC POLICY THEY OPPOSE THE PROCESS THE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION SAID IN STATEMENTS THAT BODY COMPOSTING DOES NOT PROMOTE HUMAN DIGNITY SOME JEWISH RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE ALSO AGAINST BODY COMPOSTING THEY SAY IT VIOLATES JEWISH RELIGIOUS LAW OTHER OPPONENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A LACK OF RESEARCH THEY FEAR THE BODY COMPOST MIGHT POISON THE SOIL THEY ALSO FEAR MISUSE OF THE BODY SOIL WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH IT IF THEY TAKE IT ALL HOME SAID STACEY KLEINMAN SHE IS A BOARD MEMBER OF THE COLORADO FUNERAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THE GROUP HELPED TO WRITE THE LEGISLATION BUT HAS SAID IS NOT FOR OR AGAINST BODY COMPOSTING OPPOSITION ASIDE SEVERAL OTHER U S STATES ARE CONSIDERING BODY COMPOSTING MORE AMERICANS SEEM TO BE BECOMING OPEN TO GREEN BURIAL PRACTICES THIS PAST SUMMER THE CHOICE MUTUAL INSURANCE AGENCY ASKED ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AMERICANS HOW THEY WANTED THEIR BODIES TO BE DEALT WITH TRADITIONAL BURIAL AND CREMATION WERE THE COMMON ANSWER HOWEVER ELEVEN PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD CHOOSE A BURIAL INVOLVING A NATURAL PROCESS BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY ONLY FOUR PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD CHOOSE THAT CHOICE MUTUAL DID NOT SPECIFICALLY ASK ABOUT BODY COMPOSTING BUT THE RESULTS SEEM TO SHOW AN INCREASED INTEREST IN MORE NATURAL AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY OPTIONS THE NATURAL FUNERAL CHARGES SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR BODY COMPOSTING COMPARED WITH TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR FLAME CREMATION VIDDAL NOTES THAT A TRADITIONAL BURIAL AND SERVICE IN THE DENVER AREA CAN COST MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET COMPOSTED ANY BODIES BUT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED UP AND PAID FOR THE SERVICE MICAH TRUMAN IS HEAD OF THE COMPANY RETURN HOME NEAR SEATTLE WASHINGTON SO FAR HIS COMPANY HAS COMPOSTED SIXTEEN BODIES TRUMAN SAID BODY COMPOSTING IS NEW SO HE SAID IT IS A MATTER OF CHANGING HEARTS AND MINDS RIGHT NOW BUT HE HAS BEEN SURPRISED BY HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TEACH US HOW TO DIE BETTER IT HAS BEEN REALLY POWERFUL FOR US TRUMAN SAID HE ADDED THAT YOUNGER

voa-6dffc231-cb3e-4662-afd5-f1208cbffed83 SHERLOCK HOLMES IS AN IMAGINARY PRIVATE DETECTIVE CREATED BY BRITISH WRITER ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES DOYLE'S STORIES ABOUT THE DETECTIVE HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO MOVIES AND TELEVISION SHOWS ONE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' GREAT SKILLS IS A POWERFUL MEMORY IN A RECENT BBC TELEVISION SERIES THE CHARACTER USES A MEMORY TECHNIQUE CALLED A MIND PALACE OR MEMORY PALACE ON ONE SHOW FOR EXAMPLE HOLMES HAS BEEN SEVERELY WOUNDED IN A SHOOTING AND RETREATS INTO HIS MIND TO SEARCH FOR WAYS TO SURVIVE HE VISITS ROOMS IN HIS MIND PALACE LOOKING FOR HELPFUL MEMORIES IN ONE ROOM HE FINDS HIS CHILDHOOD DOG AND THE MEMORY HELPS CALM THE DETECTIVE THE MEMORY PALACE IDEA WAS NOT A BBC CREATION THE METHOD FOR REMEMBERING HAS EXISTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MANY LANGUAGE EDUCATORS TODAY TEACH THEIR STUDENTS HOW TO USE THE METHOD TO IMPROVE THEIR LANGUAGE SKILLS BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS A MEMORY PALACE IT IS A REAL STRUCTURE SUCH AS A HOME OR BUILDING THAT YOU CAN PICTURE IN YOUR HEAD YOU THEN IMAGINE PLACING THINGS YOU WANT TO REMEMBER INSIDE THE STRUCTURE YOU CAN USE A MEMORY PALACE TO REMEMBER WORDS PHRASES FACTS OR EVEN THE ORDER OF EVENTS IF YOU CAN SEE THE INSIDE OF A HOUSE OR BUILDING IN YOUR MIND YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN MEMORY PALACE ON TODAY'S EDUCATION TIPS WE WILL SHOW YOU HOW START WITH A LIST OF WORDS OR PHRASES THAT YOU WANT TO REMEMBER THEN CLOSE YOUR EYES AND CHOOSE A PHYSICAL SPACE THAT YOU KNOW WELL SUCH AS YOUR HOME A SCHOOL YOU ATTENDED OR A CURRENT OR FORMER WORKPLACE IF YOUR CHOSEN SPACE HAS ONLY ONE OR TWO ROOMS DO NOT WORRY YOU CAN ALSO USE THINGS LIKE DOORS PASSAGEWAYS STEPS OR OTHER PERMANENT PLACES ALONG THE PHYSICAL PATH THE NEXT STEP IS TO IMAGINE WALKING THROUGH THE SPACE USING THE PATH THAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY TAKE THROUGH IT AS YOU WALK THROUGH PUT OBJECTS THAT YOU WANT TO REMEMBER AT SPECIFIC PLACES ALONG THE PATH LEAVE THE OBJECTS THERE TO PICK UP LATER WHEN YOU VISIT YOUR MEMORY PALACE NOW LET'S TRY THIS TECHNIQUE BY USING SIX INGREDIENTS FOR A PIZZA FLOUR WATER DRY YEAST TOMATO SAUCE CHEESE AND BASIL CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PICTURE A HOME FIRST YOU OPEN THE FRONT DOOR AND SEE A BAG OF FLOUR ON THE FLOOR THE BAG IS BROKEN AND SOME OF THE FLOUR HAS SPILLED YOU ARE WORRIED THAT YOU MIGHT SLIP SO YOU CAREFULLY STEP OVER THE AREA SECOND YOU WALK INTO YOUR BEDROOM ON TOP OF YOUR BED SITS A CUP OF WATER THE CUP IS SHAPED LIKE AN UPSIDE DOWN PIECE OF PIZZA YOU THINK ABOUT HOW FUNNY THAT IS AND LAUGH ABOUT IT THIRD AS YOU ENTER THE LIVING ROOM YOU SEE A VERY LARGE SPOON OF DRY YEAST SITTING ON THE SOFA THE SPOON IS WATCHING A COOKING SHOW ON TELEVISION FOURTH WHILE STANDING IN THE LIVING ROOM YOU NOTICE THE ROOM HAS A STRANGE SMELL TO IT YOU LOOK ABOVE THE TELEVISION AND SEE A BLOCK OF CHEESE HANGING ON THE WALL FIFTH YOU WALK INTO THE KITCHEN AND SEE TWO TOMATOES CHASING EACH OTHER AROUND THE ROOM SUDDENLY THEY CRASH AND EXPLODE COVERING THE FLOOR IN RED AND SIXTH YOU OPEN THE BACK DOOR AND GO OUTSIDE THERE YOU SEE A GROUP OF VERY TALL GREEN BASIL PLANTS IN A FUNNY VOICE THE TALLEST PLANT SAYS CHOOSE ME CHOOSE ME DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING STRANGE ABOUT THE PALACE IT WAS FULL OF EXTRAORDINARY AND HUMOROUS IMAGERY WE WILL SAY MORE ABOUT THAT IN A FEW MINUTES BUT FIRST LET'S CHECK HOW WELL OUR TECHNIQUE WORKED SEE IF YOU CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS ONE WHAT WAS ON THE WALL ABOVE THE TELEVISION TWO WHERE WERE THE TOMATOES AND WHAT WERE THEY DOING THREE WHICH OBJECT WAS SITTING ON THE BED FOUR WHERE WAS THE YEAST AND WHAT WAS IT DOING FIVE WHICH INGREDIENT SPOKE AND WHAT DID IT SAY SIX WHAT DID YOU SEE WHEN YOU OPENED THE FRONT DOOR MY GUESS IS THAT YOU REMEMBERED EVERYTHING IN OUR MEMORY PALACE THAT'S GOOD NEWS EXPERTS OFFER SOME ADVICE FOR MAKING STRONG MEMORY PALACES FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WANT TO REMEMBER A LOT OF WORDS MEMORY TRAINER ANTHONY METIVIER SUGGESTS FIRST DRAWING A SIMPLE MAP OF YOUR MEMORY PALACE THEN NUMBER THE PLACES ALONG YOUR PATH WHERE YOU WILL PUT THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO REMEMBER YOU CAN PUT MORE THAN ONE THING IN EACH ROOM OR AREA LATER YOU WILL ADD THE MENTAL IMAGERY ENGLISH TEACHER JAMES OF THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL JAMESESL ENGLISH LESSONS HAS ADDITIONAL ADVICE IN HIS VIDEO ON MEMORY PALACES HE SAYS THAT THERE ARE THREE KEYS TO A STRONG MEMORY PALACE THEY ARE EMOTION MOVEMENT AND CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE OBJECT AND SOMETHING PERMANENT BOTH HE AND METIVIER SAY IMAGINING THINGS IN A HUMOROUS OR CRAZY WAY IMPROVES YOUR ABILITY TO REMEMBER THEM THESE EXPERTS ALSO AGREE THAT CONNECTING IMAGES TO ACTIONS OR MOVEMENT WILL CREATE LASTING MEMORIES FOR INSTANCE THE TOMATOES WERE CHASING EACH OTHER AND THE BASIL SPOKE AND FINALLY TEACHER JAMES SUGGESTS PLACING THE OBJECTS NEXT TO OR ON SOMETHING PERMANENT IN YOUR PALACE BEDS SOFAS FLOORS WALLS DOORS ''“ ALL OF THESE ARE PERMANENT THE BLOCK OF CHEESE WAS ON THE WALL FOR EXAMPLE NOW IT'S YOUR TURN PICK A LIST OF ENGLISH WORDS OR PHRASES THAT YOU HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING AND TRY THIS METHOD ON YOUR OWN LET US KNOW HOW IT GOES I'M JOHN RUSSELL AND I'M ALICE BRYANT

voa-704fd4c5-0a91-4c8d-aca7-390b4104ad733 COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE PLEASED WITH A RECENT GOVERNMENT DECISION ON INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS YET MANY SCHOOLS FEAR THEY ARE LOSING A LARGER FIGHT OVER THE NATION'S REPUTATION AS A PLACE THAT WELCOMES THE WORLD'S VERY BEST STUDENTS U S UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS SEE IT AS A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT THEY HAVE WORKED FOR THEY ARE CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS TOP AIDES THEY SAY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT IMMIGRATION HAVE SENT STUDENTS A MESSAGE THAT THEY ARE NOT WELCOME IN AMERICA COLLEGES SAY FOREIGN STUDENTS ARE LISTENING SINCE TRUMP WAS ELECTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE NUMBER OF NEW INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS COMING TO THE U S HAS FALLEN BY TEN PERCENT AFTER YEARS OF GROWTH ALREADY THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE CORONAVIRUS HEALTH CRISIS AND A SLOWDOWN OF VISA PROCESSING COULD PREVENT THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS FROM RETURNING IN A FEW WEEKS FOREIGN STUDENTS NOW HAVE TROUBLE PREDICTING WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER SEEING HOW QUICKLY POLICIES CAN CHANGE KIM WILCOX HEADS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE SHE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THERE IS A GROWING SENSE THE U S IS NOT A WELCOMING PLACE HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES IS STILL SEEN AS THE GOLD STANDARD BUT ACCESS TO IT COMES WITH ALL KINDS OF RISKS SAID WILCOX THE ADMINISTRATION'S LATEST POLICY WOULD HAVE FORCED INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS IN THE U S TO CHANGE SCHOOLS OR LEAVE THE COUNTRY IF THEIR SCHOOLS HELD CLASSES ENTIRELY ONLINE BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC EVEN THOSE AT UNIVERSITIES OFFERING A MIX OF ONLINE AND IN PERSON CLASSES WOULD HAVE BEEN BARRED FROM TAKING ALL THEIR CLASSES ONLINE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED COLLEGES SUPPORTED LEGAL EFFORTS BY HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY OR MIT TO OVERTURN THE POLICY SEVEN OTHER CASES FOLLOWED AS COLLEGES AND STATE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS QUESTIONED THE GUIDANCE CALLED TO COURT TO DEFEND THE GUIDANCE FEDERAL OFFICIALS CANCELLED IT INSTEAD IT WAS WIDELY SEEN AS PART OF TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN TO PRESSURE U S SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES TO REOPEN THIS AUTUMN EVEN AS THE NUMBER OF CORONAVIRUS CASES RISES BUT EVEN IN DEFEAT THE POLICY ADDED TO THE IDEA THAT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES ARE NO LONGER THE WELCOMING PLACES THEY ONCE WERE THAT IS THE OPINION OF DENIS WIRTZ HEAD OF RESEARCH AT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY IN BALTIMORE MARYLAND THE MOVE COMES AS SCHOOLS IN CANADA AUSTRALIA AND OTHER NATIONS PUSH FOR MORE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS OVER TIME WIRTZ SAID THOSE COUNTRIES MAY WIN THE WORLD'S TOP SCHOLARS IT IS PAINFUL FOR WIRTZ TO SEE HE CAME TO THE U S FROM BELGIUM IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND REMEMBERS HOW WARMLY HE WAS WELCOMED NOW HE WARNS FUTURE STUDENTS AND RESEARCHERS THAT OFF SCHOOL GROUNDS THERE IS GROWING ANGER TOWARDS IMMIGRANTS ALL THOSE GREAT SCHOLARS WHEREVER THEY ARE INDIA CHINA EUROPE MAY NOW GO ELSEWHERE OR SIMPLY STAY HOME HE SAID WE WILL SEE ITS EFFECT FOUR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW IT'S NOT FALLING OFF A CLIFF BUT OVER TIME YOU HAVE THIS CREEP DOWN TOWARD MEDIOCRITY LEADERS AT OTHER TOP RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES SHARE HIS CONCERN ONLY HOURS AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION WITHDREW THE POLICY THE PRESIDENT OF MIT RELEASED A STATEMENT IT WARNED THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE WORKING HARD TO GET STUDENTS WHO HAVE LOST INTEREST IN THE U S BECAUSE OF ITS GROWING ANTI IMMIGRANT POSITION THERE IS ALSO FEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL RETURN WITH AN AMENDED RULE AS IT DID AFTER A TWENTY SEVENTEEN TRAVEL BAN FACED LEGAL ACTION HOPING TO EASE CONCERNS MANY COLLEGES HAVE MADE STATEMENTS PROMISING TO SUPPORT THEIR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND MANY SAY THEY ARE PREPARED TO RETURN TO COURT IF NEEDED DANIEL DIERMEIER HEAD OF VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY IN NASHVILLE TENNESSEE SAYS IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE THE U S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IS STILL SEEN AS THE BEST IN THE WORLD BUT THAT COULD CHANGE HE NOTED WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIX THIS VERY QUICKLY HE SAID TALENT WILL GO WHERE IT SEES THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR ITSELF U S COLLEGES ALREADY WERE PREPARING FOR SHARP DROPS IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS COMING FROM OVERSEAS IT IS STILL UNCLEAR HOW MANY WILL ARRIVE NEXT MONTH BUT OBSERVERS EXPECT IT TO BE FAR BELOW THE NEARLY ONE POINT ONE MILLION WHO CAME LAST YEAR THE DECREASE COULD AFFECT BUDGETS AT COLLEGES THAT DEPEND ON MONEY FROM FOREIGN STUDENTS WHO USUALLY PAY HIGHER RATES FOR THEIR STUDY PROGRAMS BUT THE EFFECT INCLUDES MUCH MORE THAN BUDGETS DIERMEIER SAID INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS REPRESENT A LARGE SHARE OF THE NATION'S RESEARCH FORCE HE SAID ESPECIALLY IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING FIELDS THEY ALSO ADD A GREAT DEAL TO THE ECONOMY AND WITHOUT THEM IT WOULD SUFFER HE SAID COLLEGE LEADERS CALLED THE LATEST LEGAL BATTLE A MAJOR VICTORY THAT SHOWED THEIR POWER WHEN THEY UNITE BUT THEY ALREADY SEE OTHER FIGHTS SOON TO COME THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SHOWN IT WANTS TO LIMIT A PROGRAM THAT LETS FOREIGN STUDENTS WORK UP TO ONE YEAR DURING COLLEGE OR AFTER THEY COMPLETE THEIR STUDIES COLLEGES HAVE ALSO OPPOSED TRUMP'S RECENT SUSPENSION OF NEW H ONE B WORK VISAS WHICH MANY INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS USE TO FIND WORK I'M PETE MUSTO

CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL RECENTLY BEGAN USING EDUCATORS FROM A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER TO TEACH STUDENTS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO GIVE CONSENT TO SEXUAL ACTIVITY THE GOAL IS TO REDUCE SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND ABUSE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT BEHAVIOR IS ACCEPTABLE AND WHAT IS NOT BEFORE THEY BECOME ADULTS CENTRAL CATHOLIC HIGH IS IN THE WESTERN U S CITY OF PORTLAND OREGON DAVID BLUE IS THE SCHOOL'S DIRECTOR OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION HE SAID WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DATING VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT RELATIONSHIPS HASHTAG METOO ALL OF THOSE THINGS BLUE SPOKE TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS WHAT IS TAKING PLACE AT HIS SCHOOL REPRESENTS A LARGER DEBATE LAWMAKERS EDUCATORS AND TEENS ARE ASKING THEMSELVES WHETHER SEX EDUCATION SHOULD BE CHANGED TO BETTER DEAL WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE HASHTAG METOO MOVEMENT AGAINST SEXUAL ABUSE AT THE CENTER OF THE DEBATE IS WHETHER SCHOOLS SHOULD EXPAND THEIR PROGRAMS TO HELP STUDENTS UNDERSTAND CONSENT ''“ SOMETHING THAT IS DEFINED DIFFERENTLY FROM STATE TO STATE JENNIFER DRIVER IS STATE POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE SEXUALITY INFORMATION AND EDUCATION COUNCIL OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH SUPPORTS LIBERAL SEX EDUCATION POLICIES DRIVER SAYS THE HASHTAG METOO MOVEMENT HAS BROUGHT THE ISSUE OF CONSENT INTO THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT SHE ADDED THAT IT IS CLEAR SOME PEOPLE STILL STRUGGLE WITH THE CULTURAL CHANGE THAT IS HAPPENING DRIVER SAID WHEN DONE RIGHT SEX EDUCATION CAN SERVE AS VIOLENCE PREVENTION BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO GET THESE POLICIES ENACTED ALREADY THIS YEAR LAWMAKERS IN MANY STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE CONSIDERED SEX EDUCATION BILLS BUT ONLY FIVE STATES HAVE PASSED SUCH MEASURES AND JUST TWO REQUIRE CLEARLY DEFINED DIRECTIVES ABOUT CONSENT THAT INFORMATION COMES FROM THE GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE WHICH STUDIES SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ISSUES IN ALL TEN STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA REQUIRE THAT CONSENT BE PART OF THE SEX EDUCATION PROGRAM MORE THAN THIRTY STATES REQUIRE THAT TEACHERS TALK ABOUT ABSTINENCE IN SEX ED PROGRAMS ABSTINENCE IN THIS CASE IS THE PRACTICE OR CUSTOM OF AVOIDING OR NOT HAVING SEX IN RECENT YEARS MOST FEDERAL MONEY FOR SEX EDUCATION HAS GONE TO ABSTINENCE PROGRAMS THE DIVIDE OVER HOW TO TEACH SEX EDUCATION HAS LONG SPLIT ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER CHILDREN ARE SEXUAL BEINGS SAID JONATHAN ZIMMERMAN HE SERVES AS PROFESSOR OF HISTORY OF EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AT TIMES SEX EDUCATION CLASSES HAVE TAUGHT STUDENTS CLEAR AND DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT SEX AS WELL AS BIRTH CONTROL AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES AT OTHER TIMES THE CLASSES ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY ABSTINENCE CENTERED WITH THE HASTAG METOO MOVEMENT SOME AMERICANS SEE SEX EDUCATION CLASSES AS A WAY TO REDUCE SEXUAL VIOLENCE THIS YEAR LAWMAKERS IN OKLAHOMA CONSIDERED A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED STATE HIGH SCHOOLS TO TEACH CONSENT THE MEASURE IS CALLED LAUREN'S LAW IT IS NAMED FOR A STUDENT WHO SAID SHE WAS RAPED AT A HIGH SCHOOL PARTY THE OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE WENT ON TO PASS A NARROWER MEASURE REQUIRING THAT SCHOOLS WITH A SEX ED PROGRAM TEACH STUDENTS ABOUT CONSENT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SAME FROM SCHOOLS THAT DO NOT OFFER SEX EDUCATION CLASSES AS WITH MOST ISSUES IN EDUCATION LOCAL SCHOOL OFFICIALS PLAY A BIG PART IN SHAPING SEX EDUCATION CURRICULUM MANY STATE LAWS ON SEX EDUCATION ARE WRITTEN IN AN UNCLEAR WAY ON PURPOSE THE SOUTHERN STATE OF TENNESSEE REQUIRES

voa-77be97e7-6960-458e-8807-320caf817cfb3 SEVERAL AMERICAN STATES HAVE PROPOSED NEW LEGISLATION AND POLICIES CONTROLLING HOW THE HISTORY OF RACE AND SLAVERY IS TAUGHT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS SOME SINGLE OUT THE NEW YORK TIMES' SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT AS MISREPRESENTING U S HISTORY THE PROJECT ARGUES THAT SIXTEEN NINETEEN COULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE NATION'S BIRTH YEAR THAT WAS WHEN THE FIRST SLAVE SHIP ARRIVED IN COLONIAL VIRGINIA IT SAYS DOING SO REQUIRES US TO PLACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF SLAVERY AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF BLACK AMERICANS AT THE VERY CENTER OF THE STORY WE TELL OURSELVES ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY CONSERVATIVE LAWMAKERS AND OFFICIALS IN SEVERAL AMERICAN STATES HOWEVER SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM IN EARLY JUNE THE BOARD OF EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA VOTED TO BAN THE TEACHING OF THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT AND CRITICAL RACE THEORY CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS AN IDEA OF HOW RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY HAVE SHAPED U S SOCIETY LAWS AND POLICIES THE BOARD SAID THE PROJECT DISTORTS HISTORICAL EVENTS THE BOARD ADDED THAT TEACHERS MAY NOT DEFINE AMERICAN HISTORY AS SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE CREATION OF A NEW NATION BASED LARGELY ON IDEAS FROM THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE THE EDUCATION PUBLICATION CHALKBEAT SAYS LAWMAKERS IN ARKANSAS MICHIGAN MISSOURI AND NORTH DAKOTA HAVE ALSO TRIED TO PASS POLICIES PREVENTING THE TEACHING OF THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT NIKOLE HANNAH JONES IS THE CREATOR OF THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT SHE SAID IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO REPLACE WHAT SCHOOLS TRADITIONALLY TEACH BUT IT IS SUPPOSED TO ASK PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CAME FROM SLAVERY SINCE ITS RELEASE IN AUGUST TWENTY NINETEEN THE PROJECT HAS BEEN USED IN HISTORY AND SOCIAL STUDIES CLASSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING CHICAGO ILLINOIS AND WASHINGTON D C REBECCA MILLNER TEACHES U S HISTORY AT EASTERN HIGH SCHOOL IN WASHINGTON D C AND USES SEVERAL ESSAYS FROM THE PROJECT IN THE CLASS GOOD LUCK TO NOT WANTING TO TEACH ABOUT THE LEGACIES OF SLAVERY AND SYSTEMIC RACISM AND HAVE KIDS GET A GOOD HANDLE ON U S HISTORY SHE SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW DISTRICTS ARE DOING THAT LAST YEAR STUDENTS FROM HER CLASS ORGANIZED A DAY LONG EVENT BASED AROUND THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT STUDENTS PLANNED A MUSEUM LIKE EXPERIENCE TO TEACH THE SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ABOUT THE IDEAS BEHIND THE PROJECT SOME STUDENTS DRESSED AND ACTED AS FAMOUS BLACK ACTIVISTS OTHER STUDENTS READ POETRY THE SCHOOL MUSICAL GROUP SANG OLD SONGS FIRST SUNG BY ENSLAVED PEOPLE AT ONE STATION STUDENTS DREW OR WROTE THEIR FEELINGS IN ANSWER TO SAYINGS FROM THE PROJECT AT ANOTHER STUDENTS FILLED OUT FAMILY TREES ONE STATION SERVED AS A MEMORIAL CHRISTIAN IS A BLACK STUDENT AT EASTERN HIGH WITH THE SCHOOL MARCHING BAND HE PLAYED DRUMBEATS TO SHOW HOW ENSLAVED PEOPLE USED BEATS TO SECRETLY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER THE PRESENTATION HE SAID SHOWED HOW SOME MUSIC HAS ROOTS IN ENSLAVED BLACK PEOPLE EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE NOWADAYS IT WAS FORMED BACK WHEN WE WERE IN A HARDER TIME THE CENTRAL MESSAGE OF THE DAY WAS TO NOT LET HISTORY GO UNTOLD OR UNSEEN CHRISTIAN SAID MILLNER SAID THE IDEAS CENTRAL TO THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT '' THAT SLAVERY WAS IMPORTANT TO THE FOUNDING OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS' FIGHT FOR FREEDOM IS GOOD FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY'' ARE NOT NEW BUT SHE SAID THE WAY THE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED IN THE PROJECT REACHES STUDENTS BETTER THAN BOOKS AND OTHER RESOURCES THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT CONNECTS THOSE MESSAGES IN SUCH A POWERFUL WAY FOR STUDENTS SHE SAID REBECCA COVEN IS AN ENGLISH AND SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER AT SULLIVAN HIGH SCHOOL IN CHICAGO THE SCHOOL HAS MOSTLY HISPANIC AND BLACK STUDENTS SHE SAID THE PROJECT SHOWS STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSPECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO WRITING HISTORY THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT IS ALMOST ENTIRELY WRITTEN BY BLACK WRITERS IT GETS US TO THINK ABOUT WHO GETS TO WRITE HISTORY AND HOW DOES THAT STORY DETERMINE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE WORLD COVEN SAID MANY TIMES SHE ADDED STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT SLAVERY FROM A WHITE PERSPECTIVE WITH THAT IN MIND STUDENTS IN COVEN'S SECOND YEAR ENGLISH CLASS WROTE THEIR OWN VERSION CALLED THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT SULLIVAN EDITION INSTEAD OF WRITING ABOUT THE IMPACT OF SLAVERY AND RACISM ON THE ENTIRE NATION THE CLASS FOCUSED ON THEIR IMPACT IN CHICAGO STUDENTS WROTE ABOUT THE ROOT CAUSES OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS LIKE THE WEALTH GAP INEQUALITY IN EDUCATION AND AMERICA'S LARGE PRISON SYSTEM THE STUDENTS' PROJECT INCLUDES DISCUSSIONS AND SURVEYS WITH STUDENTS AND SCHOOL OFFICIALS ABOUT RACISM AND OTHER ISSUES IT ALSO CONTAINS POETRY AND DRAWINGS WITH THIS PROJECT I WANTED STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SLAVERY CREATED A SOCIAL HIERARCHY THAT STILL IMPACTS OUR INSTITUTIONS TODAY COVEN SAID RAYMON IS A STUDENT IN COVEN'S CLASS HE WROTE ABOUT THE HISTORICAL REASONS WHY BLACK AMERICANS ARE LESS TRUSTING OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND LESS LIKELY TO GET THE COVID NINETEEN VACCINE HE SAID SPREADING KNOWLEDGE OF THESE ISSUES COULD HELP CREATE CHANGE IT IS IMPORTANT TO LEARN ABOUT THE UNFORTUNATE HISTORY INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PAINT AMERICA AS THIS PERFECT PLACE HE SAID ADU IS ANOTHER STUDENT IN COVEN'S CLASS SHE THINKS THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN STATES TRYING TO BAN THE SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT AND GEORGE FLOYD'S MURDER AND THE NATIONWIDE PROTESTS FOR RACIAL EQUALITY THEY DON'T WANT US TO KNOW THE EFFECTS OF SLAVERY ARE STILL GOING ON ADU SAID WHEN GEORGE FLOYD WAS

voa-78537141-771f-40a6-be61-fb705effe8223 A DISCRIMINATION CASE INVOLVING ASIAN AMERICANS AT A TOP PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA IS MOVING AHEAD A FEDERAL JUDGE IN LATE MAY RULED THAT A PARENTS' GROUP CAN DISPUTE THE ADMISSIONS POLICY OF THE HIGH SCHOOL IN COURT THE GROUP SAYS THE NEW ADMISSIONS POLICY IS MEANT TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF ETHNICALLY ASIAN STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL THOMAS JEFFERSON HIGH SCHOOL FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COMMONLY CALLED TJ IS IN ALEXANDRIA VIRGINIA IT IS PART OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM TJ WAS RATED THE BEST PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN AMERICA LAST MONTH BY THE MAGAZINE U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT HOWEVER THE SCHOOL ACCEPTS VERY FEW BLACK AND HISPANIC STUDENTS THIS YEAR A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS AT TJ ARE BLACK OR HISPANIC HOWEVER ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS ARE IDENTIFIED AS ASIAN GOVERNMENT INFORMATION SHOWS THAT ASIANS MAKE UP ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION OF FAIRFAX COUNTY LAST YEAR THE FAIRFAX COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD CHANGED THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS AT THE SCHOOL BEFORE THE CHANGE ACCEPTANCE TO THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SCHOOL WAS BASED MAINLY ON GRADES AND TEST SCORES THE BOARD SAID IT DECIDED TO CHANGE THE PROCESS TO JUDGE STUDENTS HOLISTICALLY THAT MEANS TO CONSIDER MANY DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF A PERSON RATHER THAN A FEW A DIFFICULT ADMISSIONS TEST IS NO LONGER REQUIRED CRITICS OF THE EARLIER SYSTEM ARGUED THAT IT GAVE AN ADVANTAGE TO FAMILIES THAT COULD PAY FOR TEST PREPARATION CLASSES NOW ANY EIGHTH GRADE STUDENT WITH A THREE POINT FIVE GRADE POINT AVERAGE OR ABOVE CAN APPLY TO TJ INSTEAD OF AN EXAM STUDENTS WRITE AN ESSAY STUDENTS ARE JUDGED BASED ON A PORTRAIT WHICH CONSIDERS THINGS LIKE A STUDENT'S ECONOMIC SITUATION AND WHETHER THEY COME FROM A HOME WHERE ENGLISH IS NOT THE MAIN LANGUAGE SEATS ARE ALSO GUARANTEED TO THE TOP ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT OF STUDENTS AT ANY OF THE COUNTY'S MIDDLE SCHOOLS FAIRFAX SCHOOLS SUPERINTENDENT SCOTT BRABRAND LED THE PUSH FOR THE CHANGES AT THE HIGH SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAY THE NEW ADMISSIONS POLICIES ARE NOT AFFECTED BY RACE WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY MEMBERS OF THE TJ COMMUNITY'' CURRENT AND FORMER'' WHO HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT DIVERSITY AT THE SCHOOL BRABRAND SAID TO THE BOARD LAST YEAR TJ MUST REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF FAIRFAX COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS A GROUP INCLUDING SEVERAL ASIAN FAMILIES BROUGHT LEGAL ACTION SOON AFTER THE SCHOOL BOARD ANNOUNCED THE CHANGES THE CASE ARGUES THAT THE NEW ADMISSIONS RULES ARE MEANT TO LOWER THE NUMBER OF ASIAN STUDENTS THE GROUP CALLS ITSELF THE COALITION FOR TJ IT IS RECEIVING LEGAL HELP FROM THE PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION PLF A NONPROFIT LEGAL ORGANIZATION PLF LAWYER ERIN WILCOX IS REPRESENTING THE FAMILIES SHE SAID IN A STATEMENT TJ'S ATTEMPTS AT RACIAL BALANCING ARE NOT ONLY ILLEGAL BUT THEY ALSO HARM THE CHILDREN THEY'RE SUPPOSEDLY TRYING TO HELP SHE SAID THE SCHOOL BOARD IS BARRED FROM CHOOSING WHO CAN ATTEND PUBLIC SCHOOL BASED ON A PERSON'S RACE OR ETHNIC GROUP THE TJ ADMISSIONS LEGAL CASE IS SIMILAR TO DEBATES AT OTHER SCHOOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY OFTEN THERE ARE FEW BLACK AND HISPANIC STUDENTS AT TOP PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS STUDENTS THAT ATTEND THESE COMPETITIVE SCHOOLS ARE MORE LIKELY TO DO WELL ON SATS AND OTHER EXAMS AND ATTEND GOOD UNIVERSITIES STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL IS A TOP PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN NEW YORK CITY SIMILAR TO TJ ALMOST THREE OF FOUR STUDENTS AT STUYVESANT ARE ASIAN THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED THAT ONLY EIGHT BLACK STUDENTS OUT OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY NINE WERE ADMITTED INTO THE FIRST YEAR CLASS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND IN THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF STUDENTS ARE BLACK OR HISPANIC BUT AT LOWELL HIGH SCHOOL ONE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S TOP PUBLIC SCHOOLS THIRTEEN PERCENT OF STUDENTS ARE BLACK OR HISPANIC A STUDY PUBLISHED LAST YEAR SAID THAT DIVERSITY CAN BE GOOD FOR STUDENTS BOTH EDUCATIONALLY AND SOCIALLY RESEARCH FROM THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE IN WASHINGTON D C SUGGESTS THAT BLACK STUDENTS PERFORM BETTER ON STANDARDIZED TESTS IF THEY GO TO SCHOOLS WITH MORE WHITE STUDENTS BUT IN THE VIRGINIA CASE PARENTS ARGUE THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S POLICIES TO SUPPORT RACIAL MINORITIES HURT A RACIAL MINORITY'' ASIAN AMERICANS THE DEBATE MAY PARTLY BE ANSWERED IN THE U S SUPREME COURT BEFORE THE END OF NEXT YEAR IN A CASE BROUGHT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN A GROUP CALLED STUDENTS FOR FAIR ADMISSIONS WANTS HARVARD UNIVERSITY TO REMOVE RACE AS A FACTOR IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE USED RACE AND ETHNICITY AS ONE OF MANY FACTORS IN DECIDING WHO TO ACCEPT THE GROUP SAYS THAT HARVARD'S ADMISSIONS POLICIES DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ASIAN STUDENTS ASIANS MAKE UP TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE HARVARD STUDENT POPULATION HARVARD WON THE CASE IN FEDERAL COURT IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND AGAIN IN AN APPEALS COURT IN TWENTY TWENTY BUT LEGAL EXPERTS SAY THE SUPREME COURT IS LIKELY TO HAVE ITS OWN RULING WHILE THE CASE CONCERNS A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY WILCOX THE COALITION FOR TJ LAWYER TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT A DECISION BY THE SUPREME COURT COULD AFFECT THE TJ CASE THE PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION SUPPORTS STUDENTS FOR FAIR ADMISSIONS' SIDE IN THAT LEGAL CASE ASRA NOMANI IS A TJ PARENT WHO HAS LED OPPOSITION TO THE ADMISSIONS CHANGES SHE SAID AT A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT THE NEW POLICIES ARE PART OF GROWING RACISM AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS SHE SAID MANY OF THE TJ FAMILIES ARE RECENT IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME TO AMERICA FOR A BETTER LIFE THESE FAMILIES NEVER COULD HAVE IMAGINED THEY WOULD FACE SUCH INJUSTICE IN AMERICA SHE SAID I'M CATY WEAVER AND I'M DAN FRIEDELL

voa-7df173dc-1896-46ab-9088-1e89dfabe1cd3 WOFFORD COLLEGE PRESIDENT NAYEF SAMHAT KNOWS THE FUTURE OF HIS SCHOOL IS AT RISK THE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED STUDENT SCHOOL BASED IN SPARTANBURG SOUTH CAROLINA IS SIMILAR TO MANY SMALL PRIVATE COLLEGES THAT HAVE CLOSED IN RECENT YEARS THE CLOSURES ARE CLOSELY LINKED TO ISSUES LIKE INCREASING COMPETITION AMONG COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FOR A SMALLER TRADITIONAL STUDENT POPULATION IN UNITED STATES THAT GROUP IS MAINLY YOUNG PEOPLE COMING RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL BUT SAMHAT TOLD VOA HE IS NOT WORRIED HE SAYS HIS SCHOOL AND MANY OTHERS ARE WORKING TO FIND NEW AND DIFFERENT WAYS OF PROVIDING HIGHER EDUCATION AT WOFFORD THAT MEANS MEETING THE NEEDS OF A VERY SPECIFIC GROUP OF STUDENTS SAMHAT SAYS HE NOTES THAT A STRENGTH OF AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION IS THAT THERE ARE MANY INSTITUTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM SOME STUDENTS WANT THE EXPERIENCE OF A LARGE SCHOOL WHILE OTHERS WANT A SMALLER MORE PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WOFFORD OFFERS WITH ABOUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF ITS STUDENTS LIVING ON THE SCHOOL GROUNDS THROUGHOUT THEIR FOUR YEAR PROGRAM HOWEVER SAMHAT SUGGESTS IT IS NOT JUST LIFE IN A CLOSELY CONNECTED COMMUNITY THAT MAKES WOFFORD DIFFERENT THE SCHOOL HAS A STRONG INTERNATIONAL STUDY PROGRAM WITH HELP FROM OUTSIDE INVESTMENT THE INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION REPORTS THAT WOFFORD HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS SPENDING AT LEAST SOME TIME AT A FOREIGN UNIVERSITY DURING THEIR STUDIES IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING LOCAL COMMUNITY WE ARE A PATHWAY TO THE GLOBAL FOR OUR STUDENTS SAID SAMHAT HE SAYS WOFFORD SUPPORTS INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION TO TEACH STUDENTS ABOUT CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IT ALSO TEACHES THEM TO LOOK AT THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS IN DIFFERENT WAYS SAMHAT SAYS THE SCHOOL'S INTERNATIONAL STUDY PROGRAMS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT HAVING FUN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY STUDENTS MUST SEEK SPECIAL PERMISSION TO JOIN THE PROGRAMS EXPLAINING HOW THE EXPERIENCE CONNECTS TO THEIR MAIN FIELD OF STUDY FOR EXAMPLE AN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE STUDENT MIGHT WANT TO LEARN ABOUT HOW WATER SHORTAGES AFFECT FARMING IN AFRICA STUDENTS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES WHEN THEY RETURN TO WOFFORD IN WAYS THAT ARE HELPFUL TO OTHER STUDENTS FOR OTHER COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES OFFERING A UNIQUE EDUCATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN LEAVING THE UNITED STATES MARK ROOSEVELT IS THE PRESIDENT OF ST JOHN'S COLLEGE A SMALL PRIVATE LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE IN SANTA FE NEW MEXICO HE SAYS IT MEANS FINDING THE ONE THING YOUR SCHOOL DOES BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE HE NOTES THAT SCHOOLS ARE FEELING PRESSURE TO

voa-807c1a14-dc30-41c5-bad4-7e9333dae06c3 THE CHAIR IS A NEW PROGRAM ABOUT LIFE AT AN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO FOREIGN STUDENTS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES THE MAIN ACTOR IN THE SHOW IS SANDRA OH IN THE CHAIR OH PLAYS JI YOON KIM AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR AT A FICTIONAL COLLEGE IN THE NORTHEASTERN U S WHEN THE SHOW BEGINS KIM IS IN HER FIRST DAYS AS THE LEADER OR CHAIR OF HER DEPARTMENT SHE IS THE FIRST WOMAN TO HAVE THE JOB KIM OVERSEES A GROUP OF PROFESSORS AND ALSO TALKS OFTEN WITH ANOTHER OFFICIAL OF THE UNIVERSITY A DEAN THEY DISCUSS MANY ISSUES THESE INCLUDE HOW TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN ENGLISH CLASSES HOW TO ADD MORE PROFESSORS OF DIFFERENT RACES AND ETHNIC GROUPS AND WHETHER OLDER UNPOPULAR PROFESSORS SHOULD KEEP THEIR JOBS THE SHOW BRINGS UP PROBLEMS FACING COLLEGE PROFESSORS AND THEIR LEADERS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW BLACK PROFESSORS FEEL WHILE WORKING AT SCHOOLS WHERE THE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE MOSTLY WHITE IT TALKS ABOUT WHETHER UNIVERSITIES SHOULD CHANGE THE SYSTEM OF OFFERING TENURE TO PROFESSORS AND IT ASKS IF PROFESSORS SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO TEACH THE WAY THEY BELIEVE THEY SHOULD IT ALSO LOOKS AT THE TROUBLE KIM HAS DEALING WITH HER JOB AND HER HOME LIFE SHE IS A SINGLE PARENT OF A YOUNG ADOPTED DAUGHTER AND HAS A RETIRED FATHER WHO LIVES IN THE SAME TOWN OH'S CHARACTER SPEAKS KOREAN WITH HER FATHER AND TRIES TO TEACH THE LANGUAGE TO HER DAUGHTER ALL THE ISSUES COME UP IN JUST SIX PROGRAMS THE SHOW IS NOT REAL AND IS A COMEDY IT IS NOT TRYING TO BE A REAL RECORD LIKE A DOCUMENTARY BUT IT DOES PRESENT REAL PROBLEMS AT COLLEGES SO HOW WELL DOES THE CHAIR SHOW LIFE ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE JAY BELSKY IS A PROFESSOR OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS BELSKY STARTED HIS WORK IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN HE COMPLETED DEGREES AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY IN NEW YORK HE SAID THE STORIES PRESENTED BY THE CHAIR ARE CLOSE TO LIFE ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE HOWEVER IT IS UNLIKELY ALL THE DIFFICULT EVENTS WOULD HAPPEN AT ONCE IN ADDITION BELSKY SAID PEMBROKE THE FICTIONAL COLLEGE OF THE CHAIR ONLY REPRESENTS THE ENVIRONMENT AT A SMALL NUMBER OF U S UNIVERSITIES WHILE SOME OF THE 'WOKE NESS' AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS IS AT ALL OF THEM IT'S PROBABLY A LOT MORE INTENSE AND APPARENT AND ALL ENCOMPASSING AT THOSE ELITE OF ELITE SCHOOLS SHERA BHALA IS IN HER FINAL YEAR OF STUDY AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE DARTMOUTH IS ONE OF THE OLDEST COLLEGES IN THE U S AND AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL BHALA WROTE ABOUT THE CHAIR FOR THE DARTMOUTH THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER IN HER REPORT SHE WROTE THAT THE SHOW CAPTURES THE PECULIARITIES OF LIFE ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS AND NOTED THAT IT BALANCES BEING A COMEDY WITH TRAGIC REALITIES SHE ALSO COMMENTED THAT THE OUTDOOR SCENES FROM THE CHAIR REMINDED HER OF DARTMOUTH ALTHOUGH THE SHOW WAS MOSTLY FILMED IN PENNSYLVANIA IS THE CHAIR GOOD TO WATCH FOR A STUDENT CONSIDERING STUDY IN THE U S BHALA THOUGHT OF HER MOTHER WHO GREW UP IN MALAYSIA SHE SAID HER MOTHER OFTEN ASKED WHETHER LIFE AT AN AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE WAS LIKE THE LIFE SHOWN IN MOVIES AND TELEVISION YEAH I THINK FOR A STUDENT FROM ASIA OR ANYWHERE OUTSIDE AMERICA I THINK IT COULD BE A VERY INTERESTING SHOW TO WATCH BHALA APPROVED OF THE SHOW'S ATTEMPT TO SHOW AN ASIAN WOMAN AS A UNIVERSITY LEADER SHE NOTED THAT U S UNIVERSITIES ARE CURRENTLY HAVING REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DIVERSITY OH'S PARENTS CAME TO CANADA FROM SOUTH KOREA IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SPEAKING TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS SHE SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT HER CHARACTER HAD A KOREAN FIRST NAME HER BEST KNOWN TELEVISION CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN NAMED CRISTINA AND EVE TO BE ACTUALLY ABLE TO PUT A KOREAN NAME AND HAVE ALL THE CHARACTERS SAY YOUR NAME IT REALLY APPEALED TO ME OH SAID THE CHAIR IS THE FIRST MOVIE OR TELEVISION SHOW IN A NUMBER OF YEARS TO TELL A STORY ABOUT A PROFESSOR AT AN AMERICAN COLLEGE SOME CRITICS SAID IT IS THE FIRST TO DO SO SINCE THE WONDER BOYS THAT FILM CAME OUT OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO THE CHAIR SHOWS TWO SIDES OF KIM'S LIFE AS A UNIVERSITY LEADER AND AS A SINGLE PARENT WHILE BHALA IS A YOUNG PERSON SHE HAS EXPERIENCE WITH ACADEMIA BECAUSE SHE FOLLOWED HER FATHER WHO IS A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS SHE SAID SHE IS GLAD THE SHOW TRIES TO SHOW CURRENT COLLEGE LIFE THE SHOW DEFINITELY HAS KIND OF THIS CURRENT PERSPECTIVE WHICH WAS REFRESHING TO SEE IN A SHOW ABOUT ACADEMIA BELSKY THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PROFESSOR SAID IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT KIM LEADS THE SCHOOL'S ENGLISH DEPARTMENT HE PROPOSED THAT A SHOW ABOUT ENGINEERING OR CHEMISTRY MIGHT BE VERY DIFFERENT SO I THINK YOU REALLY HAVE TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES VERSUS THE REST OF THE CAMPUS BELSKY ALSO PROPOSED THAT WHILE THE SHOW IS GETTING NOTICED IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY ONLY CONNECT WITH A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS NOT MANY PEOPLE IN THE U S ATTENDED SCHOOLS LIKE THE ONE IN THE CHAIR BHALA THOUGHT ONE PART OF THE SHOW WAS OVERSTATED THE IDEA THAT OLDER PROFESSORS ARE OUT OF TOUCH AND UNABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE CURRENT COLLEGE STUDENTS I'VE BEEN REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE PROFESSORS WHO ARE ENERGETIC BRILLIANT AND LIKE ON TOP OF ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THEIR FIELDS I'M DAN FRIEDELL

voa-8b584e28-9ee8-4218-9c6b-346c5058ef3b3 EVERY DAY MILLIONS OF STUDENTS RECEIVE MEALS AT SCHOOLS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM IS A FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAM THAT OPERATES IN PUBLIC AND NON PROFIT PRIVATE SCHOOLS IT PROVIDES MEALS TO AROUND THIRTY MILLION CHILDREN NATIONWIDE ABOUT TWENTY MILLION OF THE STUDENTS MEET REQUIREMENTS FOR A FREE LUNCH OR LIGHT MEAL DURING THE SCHOOL DAY ABOUT TWO MILLION OTHERS QUALIFY FOR A REDUCED PRICE THEY PAY FORTY CENTS A DAY FOR LUNCH THE NEARLY EIGHT MILLION REMAINING STUDENTS ARE CHARGED THE FULL PRICE FOR THEIR MEALS BUT SOME OF THEIR PARENTS MAY STRUGGLE TO PAY THESE COSTS OVER THE YEARS U S SCHOOLS HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT METHODS TO COLLECT UNPAID LUNCH MONEY BUT NOT ALL OF THESE METHODS ARE POPULAR RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OFFICIALS LEARNED RECENTLY THAT DENYING CHILDREN A HOT MEAL LED TO STRONG CRITICISM ON SOCIAL MEDIA SOME PARENTS HAD NOT PAID LUNCH MONEY FOR THEIR CHILDREN SO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD PLANNED TO SERVE THE CHILDREN COLD SANDWICHES BUT AFTER RECEIVING HUNDREDS OF COMMENTS ON FACEBOOK AND ANGRY TELEPHONE CALLS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LAST WEEK CANCELED THE PLAN CATHERINE BONANG IS WITH WARWICK PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE DISTRICT RECEIVING THE CRITICISM SHE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT THE BAD REACTION TO THE SANDWICH PLAN WAS GLOBAL SUCH PLANS ARE NOT NEW BUT THEY ARE INCREASINGLY FACING PUBLIC CRITICISM IF A CHILD IS SEEN EATING A COLD MEAL FOR EXAMPLE IT BECOMES CLEAR WHO OWES MONEY AND THIS CAN CAUSE FEELINGS OF GUILT OR SHAME THE MOVEMENT AGAINST LUNCH SHAMING IS GAINING POPULARITY AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THE PAST WARWICK STUDENTS WHO OWED LUNCH MONEY WERE SERVED CHEESE SANDWICHES THAT ARE NOT ON THE NORMAL MENU SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFICIALS WANTED TO MAKE THIS LESS NOTICEABLE BY CHANGING TO A KIND OF SANDWICH THAT IS OFFERED TO EVERYONE BONANG EXPLAINED BUT CRITICISM PUSHED OFFICIALS TO SAY ALL STUDENTS WOULD GET THE CHOICE OF A HOT MEAL A POLICY OF NOT LETTING OLDER STUDENTS WITH UNPAID FEES TAKE PART IN SCHOOL TRIPS DANCES OR OTHER ACTIVITIES WAS ALSO RECENTLY STOPPED THE DISTRICT SAID IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW COMMON LUNCH SHAMING IS AMONG THE NATION'S THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS BUT IN TWENTY ELEVEN MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAD UNPAID MEAL FEES THAT INFORMATION COMES FROM A STUDY BY THE U S DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OR USDA WHICH SUPERVISES THE FEDERAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM AMONG THOSE DISTRICTS SCHOOLS OFTEN SERVED ALTERNATIVE MEALS SUCH AS SANDWICHES DISTRICTS ALSO REPORTED TAKING OTHER ACTIONS TO COLLECT MONEY SUCH AS NOT GIVING STUDENTS THEIR CLASS MARKS NEW MEXICO PASSED A LAW AGAINST SUCH ACTIONS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SEVERAL OTHER STATES HAVE FOLLOWED ITS EXAMPLE THEY INCLUDE CALIFORNIA IOWA AND OREGON THEIR LAWS GENERALLY DO NOT PERMIT ACTIONS LIKE MAKING STUDENTS DO WORK AROUND THE SCHOOL YET SERVING ALTERNATIVE MEALS IS NOT ALWAYS BANNED SUPPORTERS OF THE LAW SAY STUDENTS SHOULD NEVER GO HUNGRY AT SCHOOL OR BE SHAMED WITH FOOD LAST MONTH U S LAWMAKERS PROPOSED ANTI LUNCH SHAMING BILLS TO HELP PROTECT CHILDREN WITH UNPAID FEES THE USDA DOES NOT SUPPORT ACTIONS THAT IDENTIFY SUCH STUDENTS BUT GIVES SCHOOL DISTRICTS PERMISSION TO SET THEIR OWN POLICIES A CHILD CAN FEEL SHAME EVEN IF OTHER CHILDREN DO NOT KNOW WHY THEY ARE GETTING A COLD SANDWICH SAID JENNIFER RAMO SHE IS WITH AN ORGANIZATION CALLED NEW MEXICO APPLESEED IT WORKS ON IMPROVING THE LIVES OF POOR PEOPLE AFTER FORGETTING TO PAY LUNCH MONEY FOR ONE WEEK ONE PARENT SAID HER YOUNG SON WAS GIVEN A SUNFLOWER BUTTER SANDWICH LAST YEAR THE MOTHER SAID HER HEART BROKE WHEN SHE PICKED HIM UP AT SCHOOL AND HE ASKED WHY SHE HAD NOT PAID SHE WAS ALSO CHARGED TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR THE SANDWICH THE SAME PRICE AS FOR A HOT MEAL THE WOMAN LIVES IN CRANSTON RHODE ISLAND NOT FAR FROM WARWICK CRANSTON'S SCHOOL DISTRICT SAID IT NO LONGER SERVES ALTERNATIVE MEALS REASONS FOR UNPAID FEES CAN ALSO BE DIFFERENT SOME FAMILIES MAY STRUGGLE TO PAY BASIC LIVING COSTS EVEN IF THEY DO NOT QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE LUNCHES OTHERS MAY FEEL SHAME IN APPLYING FOR SUCH MEALS OR NOT REALIZE THEY QUALIFY THE SCHOOL NUTRITION ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS LUNCH ROOM OPERATORS AND SUPPLIERS IT SAYS PROVIDING FREE LUNCHES FOR ALL STUDENTS WOULD END QUESTIONS ABOUT CHARGES FOR MEAL MONEY THE USDA REPORT FROM A FEW YEARS AGO SAID LOST MONEY FROM UNPAID MEALS REPRESENTED A SMALL PART OF A SCHOOL FOOD PROGRAM'S TOTAL SPENDING BUT SITUATIONS ARE DIFFERENT THE SCHOOL NUTRITION ASSOCIATION SAYS UNPAID MEAL FEES ARE A COMMON ISSUE IT SAID DEBT IS INCREASING IN PLACES THAT STARTED ANTI LUNCH SHAMING POLICIES THE DEBT IS AT ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CRANSTON RHODE ISLAND IN JANUARY OFFICIALS THERE STARTED USING A DEBT COLLECTOR MICHAEL CRUDALE IS WITH CRANSTON PUBLIC SCHOOLS HE SAYS SIMPLY GETTING A LETTER FROM A COLLECTION AGENCY CAN SOMETIMES GET FAMILIES TO PAY HE SAID PARENTS' CREDIT RATING SCORES ARE NOT AFFECTED BUT THAT LETTERS ARE SENT

voa-8ce8305f-cc72-46b8-adab-b782c3ebf9c23 RETURNING TO SCHOOL IN WASHINGTON D C DURING THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS HAS BEEN AN EXPERIMENT IN LEARNING CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE TRYING OUT IN PERSON SCHOOLING FOR SMALL GROUPS A CHARTER SCHOOL IS A TAX SUPPORTED SCHOOL CREATED THROUGH A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN A SCHOOL BOARD AND AN OUTSIDE GROUP MERIDIAN CHARTER SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE EXPERIMENTED WITH WAYS TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE NEW CORONAVIRUS THE SCHOOL SET UP TALL THREE SIDED DIVIDERS TO KEEP STUDENTS SEPARATED BUT THEN SCHOOL OFFICIALS LEARNED THAT THIS WOULD NOT REALLY PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS NOW THE DIVIDERS ARE NOT REQUIRED BUT MORE THAN HALF OF THE STUDENTS STILL USE THEM AS PERSONAL ORGANIZERS ''“ PUTTING NOTES AND PICTURES ON THEM IT'S ALL A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND IT'S ALL PLAYING OUT IN REAL TIME SAID MATT MCCREA MERIDIAN'S HEAD OF SCHOOL MOST OF WASHINGTON'S FIFTY TWO THOUSAND PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE DEALING WITH LEARNING ON COMPUTERS IN VIRTUAL CLASSROOMS BUT MORE THAN TEN CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE EXPERIMENTED BY GIVING IN PERSON CLASSES TO SMALL GROUPS OF STUDENTS THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE SMALLER AND SOMETIMES HAVE BETTER RESOURCES THAN THE D C PUBLIC SCHOOLS SYSTEM OR DCPS SO THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THESE CHANGES QUICKLY THIS IS OUR ATTEMPT TO REDESIGN SCHOOL SAID MYRON LONG HE IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SOCIAL JUSTICE SCHOOL IT IS OFFERING IN PERSON CLASSES TO ABOUT FIFTEEN OF ITS FIFTY TOTAL STUDENTS IT IS A PROCESS THAT WASHINGTON D C PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAS WATCHED AS THE ORGANIZATION PLANS ITS OWN RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER HAD PLANNED TO START THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR WITH A COMBINED MODEL THE IDEA WAS TO HAVE VIRTUAL LEARNING WITH TWO DAYS EACH WEEK OF IN SCHOOL TEACHING HOWEVER THE CITY HAD TO CHANGE THAT PLAN BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS RAISED BY THE TEACHERS' UNION THE CITY STUDIED THE CHARTER EXPERIMENTS TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING BOWSER SAID BUT SHE NOTED DCPS WILL HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT SIXTY BUILDINGS FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AND OVER FOUR THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THE MOST RECENT REOPENING PLAN FOR WASHINGTON D C 'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS SEEMS TO TAKE IDEAS FROM THE CHARTER SCHOOLS' EXPERIENCES PARENTS ARE GIVEN CHOICES FOR HOW THEY WANT THEIR CHILD TO ATTEND FOR EXAMPLE ONE CHOICE WOULD GIVE IN PERSON CLASSES TO A SMALL GROUP OF STUDENTS STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS STUDENTS LEARNING ENGLISH AND STUDENTS WHO ARE HOMELESS OR OTHERWISE AT RISK WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS GROUP THOSE ARE MAINLY THE KINDS OF LEARNERS D C CHARTER SCHOOLS CHOSE FOR THEIR OWN STUDENT GROUPS FOR IN PERSON CLASSES WE WANTED THE SPOTS TO GO TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAT HAD THE GREATEST NEED SAID JUSTIN LESSEK HE IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SOJOURNER TRUTH CHARTER SCHOOL WHICH IS GIVING IN PERSON CLASSES TO TWENTY OF ITS NINETY THREE STUDENTS IN SOME CASES SPOTS OR PLACEMENTS WERE GIVEN TO THE CHILDREN OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS MERIDIAN CHARTER SCHOOL HAD TO DENY SOME PARENTS BUT THE SOCIAL JUSTICE SCHOOL WAS ABLE TO TAKE EVERY STUDENT WHOSE PARENT SHOWED INTEREST SOME PARENTS CONTACTED US AND JUST SAID 'WE HAVE NOWHERE FOR THEM TO GO DURING THE DAY ' LONG SAID EACH CHARTER SCHOOL DEVELOPS ITS OWN HEALTH SAFETY RULES AT MERIDIAN ALL STUDENTS AND VISITORS HAVE THEIR TEMPERATURE TAKEN UPON ARRIVAL SOCIAL JUSTICE SCHOOL DOES MORE THERE VISITING REPORTERS WERE REQUIRED TO WEAR FULL MEDICAL CLOTHING INCLUDING HAND AND FACE COVERINGS JUST TO ENTER THE BUILDING THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF TRIAL AND ERROR SAID SHANNON HODGE SHE IS WITH THE D C CHARTER SCHOOL ALLIANCE A NONPROFIT GROUP THAT ADVOCATES FOR THE CHARTER SYSTEM AT THE SOCIAL JUSTICE SCHOOL EACH OF THE THREE STUDENT GROUPS IS GIVEN A BATHROOM TO USE AT BOTH MERIDIAN AND SOCIAL JUSTICE WATER FOUNTAINS ARE NOT IN USE STUDENTS AT MERIDIAN HAVE THEIR OWN WATER CONTAINERS AND CAN FILL THEM AT SPECIAL WATER DEVICES THE SOCIAL JUSTICE SCHOOL OPENED ITS DOORS FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS FALL AFTER APPROVAL FROM THE D C PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL BOARD SO IT HAS NEVER OPERATED UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS THE SCHOOL PLACES IMPORTANCE ON THE VALUES OF SOCIAL AND RACIAL AWARENESS IT SEEKS TO BUILD A STRONG COMMUNITY AROUND ITS FIFTY STUDENTS AND FAMILIES BUT IT HAS BEEN NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS NEW COMMUNITY TO MEET OVER THE SUMMER NOW SCHOOL OFFICIALS HAVE STARTED HOLDING OUTDOOR GATHERINGS AROUND THE CITY ON WEDNESDAYS DURING THOSE HOURS THERE ARE NO CLASSES SO STUDENTS PARENTS TEACHERS AND OTHER WORKERS CAN SAFELY MEET EACH OTHER THE SCHOOL HAS ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW KIND OF IN PERSON TEACHING STUDENTS ATTENDING CLASS IN PERSON ARE JOINED BY STUDENTS ATTENDING ONLINE THROUGH VIDEO EVERYONE IN THE IN PERSON CLASSROOM IS ON A COMPUTER THE TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM TEACH ALL OF THE STUDENTS TOGETHER LONG SAID THE IDEA CAME ABOUT PARTLY BECAUSE THE SMALL SCHOOL DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TEACHERS TO TEACH IN PHYSICAL AND VIRTUAL CLASSROOMS BUT THE COMMUNAL PLAN ALSO FITS THE SCHOOL'S VALUES OF EQUALITY

VACCINE THEN OLLIE CAME IN AND SAT AT HER FEET AVERY TOLD A REUTERS REPORTER ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE IT HELPED ME BECAUSE I NEVER HAD A COVID VACCINE BEFORE SAID AVERY SHE ADDED I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT FELT LIKE BUT WHEN I SAW THE DOG IT HELPED ME CALM DOWN EARLY IN NOVEMBER CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES AGED FIVE TO ELEVEN WERE ABLE TO GET THE VACCINE EVER SINCE THEN OLLIE AND FOURTEEN OTHER DOGS HAVE BEEN HELPING THEM GET VACCINATED AT THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL THEY ARE PART OF A THERAPY PROGRAM PAID FOR BY A PET SUPPLY COMPANY EVEN BEFORE THE VACCINE THERAPY DOGS WERE ALREADY BEING USED AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL SOME CHILDREN AT THE HOSPITAL ARE FIGHTING CANCER OR OTHER SERIOUS DISEASES KRISTIN GIST IS A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD DOG THERAPY VOLUNTEER AND A FORMER HOSPITAL PROGRAMS DIRECTOR SHE IS ALSO OLLIE'S OWNER GIST SAID PARENTS WILL SOMETIMES HOLD THE DOG AND SEEM TO FEEL BETTER TOO HOWEVER SOME EXPERTS SAY THERE IS A LACK OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE PROVING THAT ANIMAL THERAPY IMPROVES A PATIENT'S MEDICAL CONDITION ONE SUCH EXPERT IS HAL HERZOG HE IS A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT WESTERN CAROLINA UNIVERSITY HE HAS BEEN STUDYING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN HUMANS AND ANIMALS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS HERZOG TOLD VOA THAT AN ANIMAL CAN DISTRACT A PATIENT OTHER THINGS HE ADDED SUCH A FAVORITE TOY MIGHT HAVE THE SAME EFFECT SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FOR SHORT TERM PREVENTING PAIN INTERACTING WITH A DOG CAN PUT YOUR MIND ON SOMETHING ELSE AND IN THAT CASE I SEE NO HARM IN DOING IT AND FOR SOME KIDS IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE HOWEVER HERZOG CRITICIZED THE USE OF ANIMALS AS A MEDICAL TREATMENT LIKE A DRUG HE SAID RESEARCH DOES NOT SHOW THAT ANIMAL THERAPY IS EFFECTIVE THERE'S BEEN TONS OF RESEARCH BUT MOST OF IT IS NOT VERY GOOD AND SOME STUDIES HAVE FOUND SOME OF THE BETTER STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT THERAPY DOGS DID NOT REALLY HAVE ANY IMPACT ON KIDS AND ADULTS THAT WERE PUT IN STRESSFUL EXPERIMENTAL SITUATIONS HERZOG SAID THE POOR RESEARCH METHODS COME IN MANY FORMS MANY STUDIES DO NOT USE A CONTROL GROUP A CONTROL GROUP HELPS SCIENTISTS UNDERSTAND IF AN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT HAS ANY EFFECT SOME STUDIES DO NOT CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF THE DOG HANDLERS THEY ARE OFTEN NICE PEOPLE AND COULD ALSO BE HELPING THE PATIENT PEOPLE INVOLVED IN ANIMAL THERAPY RESEARCH HERZOG SAID OFTEN BELIEVE IN IT SO THEIR PERSONAL OPINIONS MAY AFFECT THE RESEARCH HERZOG ALSO TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED THE FILE DRAWER PROBLEM THIS IS WHEN A RESEARCHER DOES NOT GET THE RESULTS THEY WANT AND PUT THE FINDINGS INTO A FILE DRAWER OR A PLACE THEY DO NOT LOOK OFTEN SOMETIMES HE SAID THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST MANY STUDIES ON THE HEALTHY IMPACTS OF PET OWNERSHIP AND ANIMAL THERAPY ARE PAID FOR BY THE PET INDUSTRY HOWEVER HERZOG SAID EVEN WHEN THOSE STUDIES FIND A LACK OF PROOF SOME IN THE MEDIA STILL REPORT ON THE FINDINGS IN A GOOD WAY HERZOG SAID THE MEDIA OFTEN REPORTS ON SUCH STUDIES INCORRECTLY HERZOG WROTE ABOUT ONE OF THE BEST STUDIES ON DOG THERAPY HE EXPLAINED THAT THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AT FIVE BIG AMERICAN HOSPITALS IT LOOKED AT THE EFFECTS OF THERAPY DOGS ON CHILDREN WITH CANCER THE STUDY FOUND NO CLEAR BENEFIT FROM THE THERAPY DOGS THE MEDIA HOWEVER REPORTED THAT THE STUDY DID FIND BENEFITS AS A RESULT PEOPLE MIGHT THINK ANIMAL THERAPY AFFECTS LONG TERM HUMAN HEALTH MORE THAN IT DOES HERZOG HAS PUBLISHED REPORTS ON THIS SUBJECT IN THE MAGAZINE PSYCHOLOGY TODAY HERZOG SAID HE IS NOT AGAINST THE USE OF ANIMALS IN THERAPY HE SHARES A STORY OF HIS OWN SON A NURSE IN A HOSPITAL'S CRITICAL CARE AREA THAT HOSPITAL ALSO BRINGS IN ANIMALS TO HELP NOT THE PATIENTS BUT THE HOSPITAL WORKERS HIS SON SAYS EVERYONE LOVES THE VISITS HOWEVER HERZOG THINKS DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF USING ANIMALS AS A MEDICAL TREATMENT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO PUSH DOGS ANIMALS AS MEDICINE THAT WE SHOULD HOLD THEM TO THE SAME STANDARD AS WE DO DRUGS FOR SOME PEOPLE EVEN IF THERE IS NOT PROOF THE SMILES AND HAPPY DISTRACTION MAY BE ENOUGH LAST YEAR WHEN HOSPITALS PUT COVID NINETEEN RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE THE DOG VISITS AT RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL STOPPED THEY RESTARTED IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WAS NOTHING IT WAS SILENT THE KIDS WERE BORED SAID CARLOS DELGADO A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE HOSPITAL SO THANK GOD HE TOLD REUTERS WE WERE ABLE TO START BRINGING THE PROGRAM BACK DELGADO ADDED THAT EVEN A SHORT THREE MINUTE VISIT WITH A DOG MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN THE DAY OF A PATIENT AND THAT'S THE HEALTH AND LIFESTYLE REPORT I'M ANNA MATTEO

IT LISTED SIX HUNDRED FIFTY SCHOOLS THAT REPRESENTS ONLY ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF ALL U S INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING THE MAGAZINE'S TOP FIVE ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF U S NEWS AND

EXPERTS AND PEOPLE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO HELP HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS CHOOSE THE RIGHT COLLEGE ALL OF THEM SAID STUDENTS AND PARENTS SHOULD LOOK AT MORE THAN JUST RANKINGS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT TELL THE WHOLE STORY ABOUT A SCHOOL RAY ANDERSON OF VIRGINIA IS A FORMER HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL HE NOW WORKS WITH A SERVICE CALLED AGM COLLEGE ADVISORS IT PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HIGHER EDUCATION TO STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ANDERSON SAYS WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO HIM IS KNOWING WHAT THE STUDENT WANTS LIKES AND IS CAPABLE OF DOING THE FOCUS IS ON WHO YOU ARE AND THEN WHAT SCHOOLS MATCH YOU ANDERSON SAID NOT MATCHING YOU TO THE SCHOOL ANDERSON TOLD VOA THE PUBLISHED RANKINGS CAN HELP BECAUSE THEY HAVE VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHOOLS JEFFREY STAHL AGREES THAT RANKINGS HAVE LIMITED VALUE IN HIS JOB AS A COUNSELOR AT YORKTOWN HIGH SCHOOL IN VIRGINIA HE TALKS WITH STUDENTS ABOUT COLLEGES STAHL SAYS CHOOSING A COLLEGE IS A VERY PERSONAL DECISION HE SAID THAT THE RANKINGS CAN BE HELPFUL BUT SOME STUDENTS PLACE TOO MUCH ATTENTION ON THE NAME OF A SCHOOL AND ITS POSITION IN RANKINGS SO MUCH ABOUT THE CAMPUS ENVIRONMENT STUDENTS PROFESSORS CANNOT BE SHOWN JUST BY RANKING STAHL SAID HE SUGGESTS THAT FAMILIES USE THE RANKING INFORMATION AS A STARTING POINT THEN THEY SHOULD WIDEN THEIR SEARCH MAKE THEIR OWN LIST AND GO SEE THE COLLEGES FOR THEMSELVES BUT DAVID HAWKINS IS CRITICAL OF THE COLLEGE RANKINGS HE IS WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR COLLEGE ADMISSION COUNSELING HE TOLD VOA THAT RANKINGS ARE NOT MATHEMATICALLY PROVEN TO MEASURE THE QUALITY OF ANY SINGLE COLLEGE MUCH LESS TO

PROBLEMS AS INSTITUTIONS MISREPORT DATA OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO MANIPULATE THEIR RANKING LIKE THE OTHER EXPERTS WE SPOKE WITH HE SAID STUDENTS MUST LOOK PAST THOSE RATINGS TO A GAIN A MORE FACTUAL OPINION ABOUT THE SCHOOLS FOR THEMSELVES IN JULY U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT DE RANKED FIVE INSTITUTIONS FROM ITS LIST FOR MISREPORTING INFORMATION BECAUSE OF THIS THE MAGAZINE SAID THEIR RANKING NUMBER WAS HIGHER THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIVE INCLUDED THE WELL KNOWN UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY HAWKINS NOTED THAT PEOPLE OVERSEAS MIGHT THINK THE RANKINGS COME FROM THE U S

voa-9abc3b41-05fa-44f8-bae0-757c20e4fdb23 FOR SOME PEOPLE HIGHER EDUCATION IS NOT JUST A GOAL IN LIFE BUT ALSO AN EXPECTATION IN THE UNITED STATES IF YOUR PARENTS ATTENDED A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT YOU WILL TOO EVEN IF YOUR PARENTS DID NOT GO TO COLLEGE YOU STILL HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF COMPLETING HIGHER EDUCATION IF YOUR FAMILY IS WEALTHY BUT YOUR CHANCES ARE REDUCED IF YOU COME FROM A NEEDY FAMILY A COMMUNITY WITH LIMITED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES OR YOU SIMPLY HAVE NO ONE TO FOLLOW AS AN EXAMPLE HELPING THOSE IN NEED IS ONE OF THE MAIN IDEAS BEHIND A STRATEGY OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE CALLED NUDGE THEORY OR NUDGING NUDGING IS A WAY OF CHANGING PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR THROUGH INDIRECT SUGGESTION AND BY SUPPORTING POSITIVE ACTIONS IT WAS POPULARIZED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BOOK NUDGE THE BOOK WAS A PROJECT OF A LEGAL EXPERT AND AN ECONOMIST WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO A GROWING NUMBER OF U S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES LOOK TO NUDGING AS WAY TO SUPPORT POOR MINORITY AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS THEY ALSO ARE USING IT TO INCREASE OVERALL GRADUATION RATES TWO COMMON FORMS OF NUDGING ARE EMAILS TO STUDENTS AND TEXT MESSAGES TO THEIR MOBILE PHONES SCHOOLS AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS KEEP IN CONTACT WITH STUDENTS THIS WAY OFFERING ADVICE AND HELP WHEN NEEDED HOWEVER RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY NUDGING CAN GO WRONG AND MAKING USE OF NUDGING TO INFLUENCE LARGE GROUPS OF STUDENTS IS HARDER THAN IT SEEMS ALEJANDRA ACOSTA IS A HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY EXPERT AT NEW AMERICA AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH GROUP SHE NOTES THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL QUALITIES A NUDGE CAMPAIGN MUST POSSESS IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL ACOSTA SAYS MESSAGES MUST BE TIMELY MEANING THEY REACH COLLEGE STUDENTS WELL BEFORE THE DATE BY WHICH A STUDENT IS REQUIRED TO TAKE ACTION ADDITIONALLY NUDGES SHOULD BE WRITTEN CLEARLY AND PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE IF STUDENTS START TO STRUGGLE IN CLASS SCHOOL OFFICIALS SHOULD NOT JUST MESSAGE THEM SAYING THEY SHOULD SEEK ACADEMIC SUPPORT THE MESSAGE SHOULD GIVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF SUPPORT THE COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY OFFERS AND EXACTLY HOW THE STUDENT CAN MAKE USE OF THEM THAT IS WHY NUDGES SHOULD POSSESS INTERACTIVE QUALITIES ACOSTA SAYS FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS OF SCHOOL OFFICIALS OR BE DIRECTED TO A WEBSITE FOR MORE INFORMATION IN ADDITION COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MUST ENSURE THEIR SUPPORT SERVICES ARE IN PLACE AND WORKING AS BEST THEY CAN YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO JUST SEND A NUDGE IN A TEXT OR AN EMAIL AND BE LIKE 'OKAY WE'RE DONE ' ACOSTA TOLD VOA TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR THERE HAS TO BE OTHER SUPPORTING STRUCTURES THERE TOO WHEN NUDGES WORK THEY CAN DO A LOT OF GOOD IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN A NONPROFIT GROUP AND AN EDUCATION SERVICES COMPANY LAUNCHED A NUDGING CAMPAIGN AT FOUR U S COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEY WORKED WITH NEARLY TEN THOUSAND FIRST YEAR STUDENTS AT THREE SUCH COLLEGES IN OHIO AND ONE IN VIRGINIA A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT OLDER AND MINORITY STUDENTS WHO AGREED TO RECEIVE THESE NUDGES WERE SIXTEEN TO TWENTY PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO CONTINUE INTO THEIR SECOND YEAR THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT IRIS PALMER IS A SENIOR ADVISER FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE AT NEW AMERICA SHE WARNS THAT EVEN IF NUDGES ARE CLEAR INFORMATIVE AND TIMELY THEY CAN ACTUALLY CREATE PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY FOR THE STUDENT WHO NEEDS THEM THE MOST PALMER TOLD VOA AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE I'M A STUDENT WHO HAS NEVER BEEN TO COLLEGE BEFORE MY FAMILY HAS NEVER BEEN TO COLLEGE BEFORE I COME TO COLLEGE AND I WONDER IF I'M COLLEGE MATERIAL I GET A MESSAGE THAT SAYS 'YOU'RE GETTING A FAILING GRADE IN THIS CLASS YOU NEED TO COME TALK TO YOUR ADVISER ' AND I THINK 'OH I'M FAILING I WASN'T EVEN COLLEGE MATERIAL TO BEGIN WITH I SHOULD JUST LEAVE NOW NUDGES NEED TO BE PERSONAL OR APPEAR TO BE WRITTEN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT NOT AS A GENERAL COMMUNICATION TO A LARGE GROUP SHE NOTED THIS MEANS THEY NEED TO BE STRUCTURED CAREFULLY REQUIRING SCHOOLS AND EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS THEY ARE NUDGING PALMER ARGUES SCHOOL OFFICIALS SHOULD RESEARCH WHAT THEIR STUDENTS' NEEDS ARE AND SHAPE NUDGES TO BE RELATED TO THOSE NEEDS OFFICIALS ALSO MUST NOT MAKE IT SEEM LIKE STUDENTS HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO TAKE A GIVEN ACTION BUT KELLY ROSINGER POINTS OUT THAT WHILE NUDGING IS SUCCESSFUL IN A LOT OF WAYS IT HAS YET TO SHOW SIGNS OF SUCCESS WHEN DEALING WITH VERY LARGE GROUPS ROSINGER SERVES AS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION POLICY STUDIES AT PENN STATE UNIVERSITY ROSINGER ADMITS THAT NUDGING CAN BE A LOW COST USEFUL WAY OF GETTING STUDENTS TO MEET RELATIVELY SIMPLE GOALS ON TIME THIS INCLUDES COMPLETING THE U S GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS NECESSARY FOR FINANCIAL AID HOWEVER LAST MONTH ROSINGER AND OTHER RESEARCHERS REPORTED ON A STUDY IN WHICH THEY LOOKED AT TWO NUDGING EXPERIMENTS THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH PUBLISHED THEIR FINDINGS THE EXPERIMENTS NUDGED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS THROUGH PHYSICAL MAIL EMAILS AND TEXT MESSAGES THE STUDY FOUND THAT THESE EFFORTS HAD ALMOST NO EFFECT ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS STARTING COLLEGE USING FINANCIAL AID OR CONTINUING FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT ROSINGER SAYS THE REASON THE EXPERIMENTS FAILED WAS BECAUSE THE NUDGES WERE TRYING TO REACH SO MANY STUDENTS THIS MADE THE MESSAGES SEEM MORE GENERAL AND AS A RESULT LESS EFFECTIVE SHE SUGGESTS THAT FOR NOW NUDGING WORKS BEST WHEN IT COMES FROM LOCAL GROUPS WORKING WITH SMALLER NUMBERS OF STUDENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITY JUST GETTING A MESSAGE FROM AN ORGANIZATION YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH CAN CREATE MORE OF THAT PERSONALIZATION SHE SAID IT MAY MAKE THE MESSAGE MORE SALIENT TO STUDENTS WHEN THEY'RE GETTING IT I'M DOROTHY GUNDY AND I'M PETE MUSTO

voa-9b725da7-f0cd-44a3-8789-f82feaa9c3e83 STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES THE COUNTRY'S OVERALL STUDENT DEBT REACHED A RECORD ONE POINT SIX TRILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR THE AVERAGE PERSON WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT IN THE U S OWES BETWEEN TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NEARLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN JAPAN THE GROUP THAT OVERSEES THE GOVERNMENT'S STUDENT LOAN SYSTEM RECENTLY REPORTED IT HAS BEEN LENDING OVER NINE BILLION DOLLARS TO STUDENTS EVERY YEAR SINCE TWENTY TEN SIMILAR CONDITIONS EXIST IN AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA SAYS FORMER UNITED NATIONS POPULATION DIVISION DIRECTOR JOSEPH CHAMIE HE SUGGESTS SEVERAL REASONS FOR HIGH STUDENT LOAN DEBT ONE IS THAT EMPLOYERS EVERYWHERE HAVE INCREASED THEIR DEMANDS FOR SKILLED WORKERS MAKING HIGHER EDUCATION A REQUIREMENT FOR MANY JOBS THIS MEANS MORE STUDENTS ARE SEEKING HIGHER EDUCATION WORLDWIDE THAN EVER BEFORE AT THE SAME TIME GOVERNMENTS ARE INVESTING LESS MONEY IN PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THEY ARE REFUSING TO RAISE TAXES AND USE EXISTING TAX MONEY TO MEET OTHER NEEDS CHAMIE SAYS SO MORE STUDENTS ARE ATTENDING PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE OFTEN MORE COSTLY HOWEVER STUDENTS OFTEN FIND THAT ONCE THEY COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION THEIR COUNTRY'S ECONOMY IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THEIR FINANCIAL NEEDS FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF FOUR YEAR DEGREE HOLDERS IN MALAYSIA HAD NO JOB IN TWENTY FIFTEEN A LOT OF THEM WHEN THEY'RE FINISHING ARE EITHER UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED SO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY BACK THE LOAN BECOMES A PROBLEM CHAMIE TOLD VOA EVEN IN COUNTRIES LIKE SWEDEN WHERE ATTENDING UNIVERSITY IS FREE ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS STILL BORROW AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TOTAL THAT IS BECAUSE STUDENTS STILL FACE OTHER LIVING COSTS LIKE FOOD AND HOUSING AS STUDENT DEBT HAS BECOME A GLOBAL PROBLEM COUNTRIES ARE SEEKING WAYS TO SOLVE IT AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE HAS ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM WHERE STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING BACK UNTIL THEY ARE EARNING AT LEAST FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN THE U S SEVERAL CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION HAVE OFFERED MORE EXTREME SOLUTIONS SENATORS BERNIE SANDERS AND ELIZABETH WARREN SUGGEST IT IS IN THE NATION'S BEST INTEREST TO FORGIVE ALL OR AT LEAST SOME OF THESE LOANS SOME RESEARCHERS RECENTLY ASKED WHAT THE EFFECTS OF DEBT FORGIVENESS MIGHT BE ANKIT KALDA IS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF FINANCE AT INDIANA UNIVERSITY IN SEPTEMBER HE AND RESEARCHERS FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY PUBLISHED A STUDY ON DEBT RELIEF THEIR STUDY CAME OUT OF AN UNUSUAL SITUATION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN U S COURTS FOUND THAT A LARGE FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION HAD MADE MISTAKES IN ITS RECORD KEEPING THE COMPANY COULD NOT SHOW THAT IT OWNED THE DEBT OF TWO THOUSAND BORROWERS THEREFORE THEY HAD TO REMOVE IT AND SO SUDDENLY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE TOLD THEY DID NOT NEED TO PAY BACK THE MONEY THEY HAD BORROWED KALDA AND HIS TEAM LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENED TO SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT OVERALL SUDDEN DEBT RELIEF GREATLY IMPROVED THE BORROWERS' LIVES FOR EXAMPLE NOT ONLY DID THEY HAVE MORE MONEY ''“ THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO MOVE TO A NEW AREA AND SEEK BETTER PAYING WORK IN TIME THEY BEGAN EARNING MORE MONEY ON AVERAGE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE A YEAR IN ADDITION THEY NO LONGER HAD NEGATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT LATE OR MISSED DEBT PAYMENTS ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT A NEGATIVE CREDIT HISTORY CAN HARM A PERSON'S ABILITY TO FIND A WELL PAYING JOB IN THE UNITED STATES CHARLOTTE HANCOCK ARGUES THESE FINDINGS ARE EVIDENCE ENOUGH THAT SOME KIND OF DEBT RELIEF PLAN MUST MOVE FORWARD HANCOCK IS THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR GENERATION PROGRESS THE YOUTH CENTERED RESEARCH AND ACTIVISM PART OF THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE JUST ENTERING THE TIME IN THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY CAN BE FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT START FAMILIES AND REALLY ADD TO THE ECONOMY SHE SAYS BUT THEIR ABILITY TO DO SO IS GREATLY LIMITED IF THEY HAVE DEBT HANGING OVER THEM EVEN BEYOND SOME OF THE FINANCIAL STRESSES HERE THE MENTAL BURDEN JUST BEING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN STUDENT DEBT THAT YOU FEEL YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO REPAY IS HUGE SAID HANCOCK GENERATION PROGRESS SUGGESTS SEVERAL WAYS DEBT RELIEF COULD HAPPEN THEY SUGGEST POLICY MAKERS COULD REQUIRE LENDERS TO CHANGE THEIR AGREEMENTS TO LOWER INTEREST RATES FOR EXAMPLE THEY ALSO SUGGEST EITHER TOTAL OR PARTIAL DEBT FORGIVENESS YET ANKIT KALDA AND HIS TEAM DO NOT ACTUALLY SUPPORT DEBT FORGIVENESS THEIR RESEARCH DOES NOT INCLUDE A LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR THE OVERALL ECONOMY IF DEBT WERE TOTALLY FORGIVEN IT ONLY LOOKS AT HOW DEBT FORGIVENESS WOULD HELP THE BORROWERS KALDA ALSO WARNS OF SOME OTHER POSSIBLE NEGATIVE EFFECTS IF AS A

voa-9e9605bf-536c-4eed-ab09-4f2e279b30ae3 AT VOA LEARNING ENGLISH WE SOMETIMES GET QUESTIONS LIKE THIS HOW CAN I SPEAK ENGLISH WITH MORE CONFIDENCE THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION NO MATTER WHAT LANGUAGE WE ARE LEARNING WE WOULD ALL LOVE TO SPEAK MORE CONFIDENTLY YULIANA VASQUEZ IS AN ENGLISH TEACHER SHE ALSO TRAINS TEACHERS AND IS A LANGUAGE RESEARCHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PANAMA SHE SAID LACK OF CONFIDENCE CAN COME FROM HAVING TROUBLE WITH PRONUNCIATION AND NOT HAVING A WIDE ENOUGH VOCABULARY IF YOU LACK CONFIDENCE WHEN YOU SPEAK ENGLISH YOU MAY DO ONE OR MORE OF THESE THINGS WITHOUT REALIZING IT SPEAK IN SHORT PHRASES SPEAK TOO SOFTLY SPEAK TOO FAST OR UNCLEARLY SO TODAY WE HAVE SEVERAL PIECES OF ADVICE TO HELP YOU GAIN CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ENGLISH SPEAKING ABILITY BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON YOU TALK TO EVERY DAY IS YOURSELF IN OTHER WORDS YOUR THOUGHTS MATTER SO OUR FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE IS TO USE POSITIVE SELF TALK IF YOU LACK CONFIDENCE AS AN ENGLISH SPEAKER YOU MAY TELL YOURSELF THINGS LIKE ENGLISH IS TOO HARD AND I WILL NEVER IMPROVE WHEN YOU TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE YOU MAY SAY THINGS LIKE I'M SO SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH BUT IF YOU KEEP THINKING AND SAYING SUCH THINGS YOU ARE SURE TO START BELIEVING THEM MAGDI SALEH IS AN ENGLISH TEACHER AND TEACHER TRAINER BASED IN CAIRO EGYPT SALEH SAID MANY ENGLISH LEARNERS NEED TO SHOW THEMSELVES MORE PATIENCE BECAUSE PROGRESS TAKES TIME YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT WITH YOURSELF AND TALK POSITIVELY WITH YOURSELF HE SAID YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF SOMETHING LIKE TODAY I WILL LEARN THIS THING AND TOMORROW I WILL LEARN OTHER THINGS SO THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE USING YOUR ENGLISH PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU TELL YOURSELF OR OTHERS BE SURE TO REPLACE UNHELPFUL THOUGHTS OR IDEAS WITH BETTER ONES THE NEXT TIP IS TO SPEAK LOUDER AND SLOW DOWN YOUR SPEECH WHEN I TAUGHT ENGLISH AT A LANGUAGE SCHOOL IN WASHINGTON D C I NOTICED SOMETHING ABOUT MY STUDENTS THOSE WHO LACKED CONFIDENCE SPOKE TOO SOFTLY AND THEY DID NOT ENUNCIATE WELL OFTEN I HAD TO ASK THEM TO REPEAT THEMSELVES A FEW TIMES TO SOUND MORE CONFIDENT SPEAK LOUD ENOUGH THAT ANYONE IN THE SAME ROOM CAN EASILY HEAR YOU AND TRY TO SLOW DOWN YOUR SPEECH IF YOU SPEAK TOO FAST MANY ENGLISH LEARNERS WORRY THAT SPEAKING TOO SLOW WILL MAKE THEM SOUND INEXPERIENCED BUT SPEAKING TOO FAST MAY CAUSE MORE MISTAKES SO AVOID WORRYING THAT YOU ARE SPEAKING TOO SLOW FOR THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU OUR THIRD TIP IS TO SPEAK IN COMPLETE SENTENCES AND GIVE LONGER RESPONSES WHEN POSSIBLE IF YOU ARE NOT CONFIDENT IN A LANGUAGE YOU WILL LIKELY TRY TO SAY AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU SPEAK TRUST ME I KNOW WHEN I VISITED BRAZIL FOR EXAMPLE I REMEMBER ASKING A BUILDING DOORMAN FOR THE FITNESS CENTER KEY IN PORTUGUESE I SAID JUST GOOD AFTERNOON FITNESS CENTER KEY PLEASE SALEH SAYS THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR LANGUAGE LEARNERS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ASK AN ENGLISH LEARNER WHAT THEIR FAVORITE COLOR IS THEY MAY GIVE A SHORT DIRECT RESPONSE LIKE MY FAVORITE COLOR IS BLUE BUT A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER IS LIKELY TO GIVE A DETAILED AND LESS DIRECT RESPONSE LIKE THIS WELL TO BE QUITE HONEST I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ACTUAL COLOR I GUESS THAT IF I WERE BUYING CLOTHES I WOULD GO FOR SOMETHING LIKE BLUE OR GREY USING COMPLETE SENTENCES AND GIVING MORE DETAIL IN RESPONSES SHOWS LISTENERS THAT YOU ARE NOT AFRAID TO SPEAK ENGLISH NOW WE MOVE TO TIP NUMBER FOUR READ OUT LOUD READING OUT LOUD CAN HELP BUILD CONFIDENCE IN HOW YOUR ENGLISH SOUNDS SO THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE READING A WEBSITE BOOK OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU ENJOY TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO READ THE MATERIAL ALOUD VASQUEZ OFFERS A POSSIBLE PLAN OF ACTION BEFORE READING ALOUD READ THE STORY SILENTLY FIRST THE SECOND TIME IF THERE IS AUDIO YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE SPEAKER AS YOU READ ALONG SILENTLY THEN TRY TO READ THE STORY OUT LOUD ALONE THEN TRY LISTENING TO THE SPEAKER AND READING OUT LOUD AT THE SAME TIME LIST WORDS YOU HAVE TROUBLE SAYING AND THEN LATER CHECK THEIR PRONUNCIATION ON GOOGLE TRANSLATE OR IN SOME OTHER PLACE SALEH ADDS THAT LEARNERS SHOULD READ FOR PLEASURE AND ENJOY WHAT THEY ARE READING SO HE ADVISES NOT STOPPING TO CHECK WORD MEANINGS IN A DICTIONARY WHILE READING ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO CONFIDENCE IN SPEAKING A SECOND LANGUAGE IS THE CONSTANT WORRY ABOUT MAKING MISTAKES SO OUR NEXT TIP IS DO NOT WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT MISTAKES UNDERSTAND THAT MAKING MISTAKES IS A NATURAL PART OF THE LANGUAGE LEARNING PROCESS YES YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PURPOSE OF SPEAKING A LANGUAGE IS TO COMMUNICATE AND MANY ENGLISH LEARNERS COMMUNICATE VERY WELL EVEN WITH MISTAKES VASQUEZ NOTES THAT MISTAKES CAN BE A GOOD THING THE MORE EXPERIENCE YOU GET THE MORE YOU WILL KNOW WHAT IS AND IS NOT CORRECT SHE EXPLAINS OUR FINAL TIP IS TO SET REALISTIC GOALS IF YOUR ENGLISH SPEAKING SKILLS ARE AT THE BEGINNER OR INTERMEDIATE LEVEL AND YOU TRY TO DO SOMETHING TOO DIFFICULT YOU MAY FAIL THIS CAN HARM YOUR CONFIDENCE BUT IF YOU DO SOMETHING THAT MATCHES YOUR LEVEL YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO DO IT WELL AS YOU LEARN ENGLISH IT IS NATURAL TO LACK SOME OF THE SKILLS YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE WELL OFTEN WHEN WE LACK SKILLS WE LACK CONFIDENCE BUT REMEMBER THAT AS YOUR SKILLS GROW YOUR CONFIDENCE WILL TOO VASQUEZ ADVISES LEARNERS TO MAKE A PLAN FOR DAILY PRACTICE AND SPEND AT LEAST THIRTY MINUTES EACH DAY PRACTICING YOUR ENGLISH I'M ALICE BRYANT

THE SOVIET UNION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT VIKTOR YANUKOVYCH REJECTED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IN FAVOR OF CLOSER TIES WITH RUSSIA THE DECISION BROUGHT MASS PROTESTS LEADING TO HIS OUSTER RUSSIA REACTED BY TAKING OVER CRIMEA AND SUPPORTING SEPARATIST REBELS IN EASTERN UKRAINE UKRAINE AND WESTERN ALLIES ACCUSED RUSSIA OF SENDING ITS TROOPS AND WEAPONS TO BACK THE REBELS

THREE HUNDRED HE WARNED THAT A LARGE SCALE ESCALATION IS POSSIBLE IN JANUARY THE UKRAINIAN MILITARY SAYS THAT RUSSIA ALREADY HAS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SOLDIERS IN THE REBEL CONTROLLED EASTERN AREA AND THE RUSSIANS ALSO ACT AS COMMANDING OFFICERS IN THE SEPARATIST FORCES RUSSIA HAS REPEATEDLY DENIED THE PRESENCE OF ITS TROOPS IN EASTERN UKRAINE IT ALSO SAYS THAT TROOP DEPLOYMENT ON ITS OWN TERRITORY SHOULD NOT CONCERN ANYONE RUSSIA HAS ACCUSED UKRAINE OF FAILING TO HONOR THE TWENTY FIFTEEN PEACE DEAL THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY FRANCE AND GERMANY THE AGREEMENT REQUIRES UKRAINE TO GIVE AUTONOMY TO THE SEPARATIST CONTROLLED AREAS AND OFFER AMNESTY TO THE REBELS RUSSIA HAS STRONGLY CRITICIZED THE U S AND ITS NATO ALLIES FOR PROVIDING UKRAINE WITH WEAPONS AND HOLDING JOINT MILITARY

MILITARY TRAINING CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY HE CHARGED THAT THE THREATS WERE MOUNTING ON OUR WESTERN BORDER WITH NATO PLACING ITS MILITARY OPERATIONS CLOSER TO RUSSIA HE OFFERED TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE ADDING THAT RUSSIA WOULD NEED LEGAL GUARANTEES RUSSIA SAYS TALK OF A RUSSIAN INVASION IS AN ATTEMPT TO HIDE UKRAINIAN INTENTION FOR AN ATTACK IN THE REBEL CONTROLLED AREA UKRAINE DENIES SUCH A PLAN SOME OBSERVERS SEE THE TROOP BUILDUP AS A DEMONSTRATION BY PUTIN TO PERSUADE WESTERN NATIONS TO STOP SENDING TROOPS AND WEAPONS TO UKRAINE LAST MONTH PUTIN NOTED THAT RUSSIAN WARNINGS FINALLY HAVE

voa-a3f02dc9-a0e5-48ce-a2b2-3511508e0ab03 AMY MELENDEZ WAS IN A SUPERMARKET IN MARYLAND WITH FRIENDS WHEN IT HAPPENED TO HER SHE HAD ORDERED ONE OF HER FAVORITE DRINKS A CORN BASED BEVERAGE FROM CENTRAL AMERICA CALLED ATOLE SHE BEGAN TO DRINK HER ATOLE WHEN A MAN NEARBY ASKED IF IT WAS GOOD BUT THE MAN WAS USING CASUAL LANGUAGE AND MELENDEZ DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS QUESTION SO SHE SAID I DON'T KNOW THE MAN THEN ASKED HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HER NOT TO KNOW HOW THE DRINK WAS THAT'S WHEN THE LAUGHTER BEGAN THE MAN LAUGHED HER FRIENDS LAUGHED AMY MELENDEZ FELT A LITTLE FOOLISH HER SPOKEN EXCHANGE WITH THE MAN WAS ENTIRELY IN SPANISH MELENDEZ IS A SPANISH LEARNER BUT SHE IS ALSO AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEACHER NOW SHE SUPERVISES ENGLISH AND SERVICE WORKER TRAINING PROGRAMS AT THREE TWO B J IN MARYLAND MELENDEZ HAS SHARED THE SUPERMARKET STORY WITH MANY OF HER STUDENTS SHE WANTS THEM TO KNOW SHE CAN RELATE TO THE CHALLENGES OF LEARNING A LANGUAGE BEING LAUGHED AT OR JOKED ABOUT CAN HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT LANGUAGE YOU ARE LEARNING AND IT MAY MAKE SOME LEARNERS NERVOUS ABOUT SPEAKING THEIR NEW LANGUAGE HOWEVER EXPERTS SAY THERE ARE WAYS TO OVERCOME THOSE FEELINGS SO ON EDUCATION TIPS TODAY WE OFFER SUGGESTIONS FROM A FEW TEACHERS BUT FIRST LET'S EXPLORE WHY SOME PEOPLE LAUGH WYNTER OSHIBERU TEACHES ENGLISH IN WASHINGTON D C AND MARYLAND INCLUDING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR LANGUAGE STUDIES AND A NONPROFIT GROUP CALLED PAPER AIRPLANES SHE SAYS MOST PEOPLE WHO LAUGH ARE NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN OR HURTFUL INSTEAD A LANGUAGE LEARNER'S PRONUNCIATION OR WAY OF PUTTING WORDS TOGETHER MAY SOUND UNUSUAL TO SOME NATIVE SPEAKERS AND CAN TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE AND THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW IT MIGHT MAKE THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL FEEL WHO'S LEARNING THE LANGUAGE IT'S JUST A NATURAL INSTINCT WHEN YOU HEAR SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR OR HOW YOU WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR IT IF THE WAY YOU SAY SOMETHING SOUNDS DIFFERENT OR UNUSUAL TO A NATIVE SPEAKER THAT PERSON MAY NOT HAVE HAD MUCH CONTACT WITH FOREIGNERS JOSH PLOTKIN IS AN AMERICAN LIVING IN BRAZIL HE HAS BEEN FLUENT IN PORTUGUESE FOR YEARS HE OPERATES A WEBSITE CALLED BRAZILIANGRINGO COM WHICH TEACHES FOREIGNERS HOW TO LIVE IN BRAZIL AND IMPROVE THEIR SPOKEN PORTUGUESE ON HIS WEBSITE PLOTKIN NOTES THAT SOME BRAZILIANS WHO HAVE LITTLE CONTACT WITH FOREIGNERS LAUGH AT HIM BECAUSE THEY AREN'T USED TO HEARING AN AMERICAN SPEAKING PORTUGUESE HE NOTES SIMILAR EXPERIENCES WHEN TRAVELING IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND TRYING TO SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGES BUT WHETHER THE REASON IS LACK OF CONTACT OR SOMETHING ELSE WE HAVE TIPS FOR OVERCOMING THE FEAR OF USING YOUR ENGLISH THE FIRST SUGGESTION IS TO RELAX AND BE PATIENT WITH YOURSELF A PIECE OF ADVICE FROM OSHIBERU SHE SAYS TO REMIND YOURSELF THAT YOU ARE LEARNING THE LANGUAGE SO IT IS NORMAL TO MAKE MISTAKES SHE ADVISES NOT TO BE TOO HARD ON YOURSELF I THINK SOMETIMES THE BEST THING TO DO IS JUST SMILE AND JUST BREATHE AND RELAX AND TRY NOT TO LET THE FEAR OF LAUGHTER STOP YOU FROM LEARNING THE LANGUAGE OR IMMERSING YOURSELF IN THE LANGUAGE OSHIBERU ALSO SUGGESTS LEARNERS AVOID SETTING LEARNING GOALS THAT ARE TOO STRICT WHICH CAN SOMETIMES BECOME A BARRIER RATHER THAN HELP OTHER EXPERTS NOTE THAT PEOPLE WHO MAKE JOKES OR LAUGH MAY NOT HAVE STUDIED A SECOND LANGUAGE THIS IS YET ANOTHER REASON NOT TO JUDGE YOURSELF BY THE REACTIONS OF OTHERS PLOTKIN WARNS AGAINST WORRYING THAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING YOU LOOK LIKE A FOOL TRYING TO SPEAK OUR LANGUAGE IDEAS LIKE THESE CAN HURT YOUR PROGRESS AND BE A BARRIER TO FLUENCY THE SECOND TIP IS TO PRACTICE YOUR SPEAKING SKILLS BOTH MELENDEZ AND OSHIBERU SAY PRACTICE IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DEAL WITH FEAR MELENDEZ SUGGESTS DOING ROLE PLAYS IN A ROLE PLAY TWO OR MORE PEOPLE ACT OUT AN IMAGINARY SITUATION FOR EXAMPLE GOING TO A MARKET OR TALKING TO A BUS DRIVER IF YOU KNOW THERE'S A NEW SITUATION ''“ A SITUATION YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN WHAT ARE THE PHRASES YOU MIGHT NEED WHAT ARE THE WORDS IS THERE SOMEONE YOU CAN PRACTICE WITH BUT DEFINITELY JUST GOING THROUGH THOSE ROLE PLAYS WILL HELP YOU OVERCOME THE FEAR YOU CAN IMAGINE FOR EXAMPLE YOUR FRIEND IS A BUS DRIVER YOU HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT TAKING THE BUS YOU CAN PRACTICE THE QUESTIONS ON YOUR FRIEND MELENDEZ SAYS IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO FIND A PRACTICE PARTNER YOU CAN PRACTICE IN YOUR HEAD OR YOU CAN TALK OUT LOUD OSHIBERU SAYS ANOTHER SOLUTION IS TO RECORD YOUR VOICE AS YOU TRAIN BY YOURSELF THAT WAY YOU CAN LISTEN FOR MISTAKES WHETHER IN YOUR WORDING OR PRONUNCIATION AND CORRECT THEM OUR THIRD TIP IS DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN THE MOMENT WHEN SOMEONE MAKES A JOKE THE SOLUTION CAN BE SIMPLE KINDLY ASK THE PERSON THE REASON FOR THE LAUGHTER LIKE THIS SAYS MELENDEZ 'IS THERE A DIFFERENT WAY THAT I COULD HAVE SAID IT ' OR 'HOW WOULD YOU USUALLY SAY IT ' SHE SAID THE ISSUE COULD BE SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE THEN ONCE YOU KNOW THE ISSUE YOU CAN BRING THE INFORMATION TO A TRUSTED PERSON SUCH AS A FRIEND OR PRACTICE PARTNER AND ASK THEM TO HELP YOU CORRECT IT THE FOURTH AND FINAL TIP IS TO KEEP A SENSE OF HUMOR KEEPING A SENSE OF HUMOR CAN MAKE THE LONG PROCESS OF LEARNING A LANGUAGE MORE FUN YOU MIGHT EVEN LAUGH WITH THE PERSON WHO IS LAUGHING OR MAKING THE JOKE THIS MAY FEEL STRANGE AT FIRST BUT GETS EASIER WITH TIME JOSH PLOTKIN NOTES THAT OVER TIME HE HAS COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT BEING LAUGHED AT WHEN SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE IS NOT A BAD THING HE HAS LEARNED NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY THESE DAYS HE EVEN LAUGHS ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE USING IT AS A WAY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS I'M ALICE BRYANT

voa-a5aa5fc7-f26a-469d-8f4c-d9e134b1462b3 BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY SOME TWO BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WILL BE USING ENGLISH OR LEARNING TO USE IT DIGITAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE WORTH ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT ESTIMATE COMES FROM THE BRITISH COUNCIL AN INTERNATIONAL CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM BASED IN BRITAIN THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR ENGLISH HAS LED MANY PEOPLE TO EXPLORE CAREERS IN TEACHING THE LANGUAGE BEING A NATIVE SPEAKER IS NOT NECESSARY TO TEACH ENGLISH IN FACT SOME EXPERTS SAY THAT BEING A NON NATIVE SPEAKER CAN BE VERY USEFUL WHEN TEACHING ENGLISH TODAY WE SPEAK WITH ONE OF THOSE EXPERTS HER NAME IS BABI KRUCHIN SHE IS A CERTIFIED TEACHER TRAINER FOR THE CERTIFICATE OF LANGUAGE TEACHING TO ADULTS OR CELTA FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS BABI KRUCHIN HOLDS A MASTER'S DEGREE IN TEACHING ENGLISH TO SPEAKERS OF OTHER LANGUAGES OR TESOL FROM HUNTER COLLEGE IN NEW YORK CITY SHE HAS BEEN TEACHING AT THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE PROGRAM AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE VOA LEARNING ENGLISH SPOKE TO HER BY TELEPHONE RECENTLY OUR INTERVIEW HAS BEEN SHORTED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PROGRAM HOW DID YOU GET INTO YOUR TEACHING CAREER SO I GOT INTO MY FIELD BY ACCIDENT I WAS ACTUALLY AN ART STUDENT IN BRAZIL AND WHEN I STARTED COLLEGE THE SCHOOL WHERE I HAD STUDIED ESL AS AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM INVITED ME TO TEACH SMALL KIDS AND I STARTED TEACHING SMALL KIDS AND I ENJOYED IT WHERE WAS THE SCHOOL THAT SCHOOL IS CALLED LOLLIPOP AND IT'S IN PORTO ALEGRE BRAZIL ''“ WHERE I'M FROM HOW DID YOU GET FROM TEACHING AT THAT SCHOOL TO TEACHING AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SO I TAUGHT AT THAT SCHOOL THEN I TRANSFERRED MY MAJOR FROM ART TO LANGUAGES AND THEN I WENT I WANTED TO LIVE IN AN ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY SO I LIVED IN THE UK FOR A YEAR WHERE I DID MY CELTA TRAINING WHICH IS A CERTIFICATE PROGRAM THEN I CAME BACK TO BRAZIL I CONTINUED TEACHING AT A BIGGER SCHOOL CALLED BRITANNIA AND THEN I STARTED TRAINING TEACHERS I WENT FROM BEING A TEACHER TO A TEACHER TRAINER IN BRAZIL AND I WAS TRAINING THROUGH THE CELTA PROGRAM AND THEN I MOVED TO THE U S AND I DECIDED TO DO A MASTER'S IN TESOL AND THEN MY CAREER KIND OF TOOK OFF I TAUGHT AT MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN NEW YORK AS AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR UNTIL I GOT A FULL TIME POSITION AT COLUMBIA WHAT SKILLS DO YOU NEED FOR YOUR PROFESSION ASIDE FROM ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLS SO I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST YES INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION SKILLS BECAUSE TEACHING IS ALL ABOUT TEACHING OTHER PEOPLE AND A GREAT AWARENESS OF WHO MY STUDENTS ARE AT MANY LEVELS LIKE AT THE PERSONAL LEVEL AT AN ACADEMIC LEVEL AT A CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS LEVEL SO THERE IS A LOT OF STUDENT AWARENESS THAT GOES HAND IN HAND WITH TEACHING SO IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS THE CONTENT AND THE PERSON WHO IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU ARE ADDRESSING THE PERSON AND THEN THINKING OF MYSELF I HAVE TO HAVE GREAT ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS TO ORGANIZE MATERIALS AND THE CLASSES AND THE STUDENT ASSIGNMENTS SO ON AND SO FORTH SO I THINK IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO GO INTO TEACHING THEY WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT BEING ORGANIZED HAVING INTERPERSONAL SKILLS TO SOME DEGREE PUBLIC SPEAKING BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A FEAR OF SPEAKING IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THAT CAREER BECAUSE YOU ARE IN FRONT OF A CLASSROOM AND ADDRESSING THEM SOME LEADERSHIP SKILLS BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO TELL STUDENTS WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING TASKS AND A GREAT DEAL OF CREATIVITY I THINK TO CREATE INTERESTING LESSONS HOW DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE DEVELOP THEIR TEACHING SKILLS IS THERE A GOOD RESOURCE FOR DEVELOPING THESE SKILLS A RESOURCE IS ALWAYS FEEDBACK FROM COLLEAGUES HAVING PEER OBSERVATIONS OR DEVELOPMENTAL OBSERVATIONS IN OTHER WORDS THE IDEA THAT IT IS NEVER READY YOU ARE NEVER DONE YOU NEVER KNOW IT ALL AND ALSO KEEPING AT THE BACK OF MY MIND THAT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS IMPORTANT SO ATTENDING CONFERENCES AND READING IN THE FIELD AND TRYING OUT NEW THINGS SO BEING AWARE OF WHAT'S NEW AND I THINK A GREAT DEAL OF REFLECTIVE THINKING I THINK WITH TEACHING ONE NEEDS TO EVALUATE WHAT HAPPENED SOMETIMES AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR CAREER IT'S GOOD TO DISCIPLINE ONE'S SELF AND DO IT MORE RIGOROUSLY ''“ THAT'S WRITE A REFLECTIVE FEEDBACK OF THE LESSON I'VE JUST TAUGHT BUT THEN AS YOU BECOME MORE EXPERIENCED I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK BACK AND SAY 'WAS THIS A GOOD CLASS WAS THIS A GOOD SEMESTER WHAT WORKED WHAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED ' WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS DO YOU HAVE FOR THOSE WHO ARE THINKING OF ENTERING THE TEACHING PROFESSION I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION IS DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE A TEACHER I HAVE SOMEBODY I KNOW WHO THOUGHT THEY WANTED TO BECOME A TEACHER AND WHEN THEY ACTUALLY WENT INTO THE FIELD THEY REALIZED THE AMOUNT OF WORK IT IS IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK SO I THINK ONE NEEDS TO BE AWARE OF THAT ''“ THAT YOU NEED TO LIKE IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST JUMP THROUGH THE HOOPS AND THE OTHER THING I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO BE AWARE OF IS THAT IN TERMS OF COMPENSATION TEACHING IS A PROFESSION THAT IS NOT VERY WELL PAID BUT ALSO TO THINK ABOUT HOW REWARDING IT IS TO MEET PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES AND TO KNOW THAT YOU LEARN ALL THE TIME FROM YOUR STUDENTS WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS DO YOU HAVE FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE A CAREER IN TEACHING ENGLISH RIGHT I WOULD SAY THAT BEING A NON NATIVE SPEAKER TEACHER OF ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE IS AN ASSET BECAUSE LIKE YOUR STUDENTS YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF LEARNING THE LANGUAGE YOU ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH WHEREAS IF ENGLISH IS YOUR FIRST LANGUAGE YOU MAY NOT EMPATHIZE WITH WHAT IT IS LIKE TO LEARN A SECOND LANGUAGE IF YOU THINK NOT BEING A NATIVE SPEAKER OF ENGLISH IS AN OBSTACLE YOU'RE WRONG BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU ANOTHER SET OF SKILLS IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD WITH RESPECT TO

voa-a79722fd-21a1-40c4-a87d-a4b8bc4f74833 FOR GENERATIONS THE UNITED STATES HAS ENJOYED ONE OF THE STRONGEST HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD BUT CONDITIONS AT U S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE CHANGING AND THAT SYSTEM NOW FACES CHALLENGES MANY HIGHER EDUCATION LEADERS WORRY ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH A NUMBER OF ISSUES IN THE YEARS TO COME HOWEVER SEVERAL EXPERTS THINK THE SCHOOLS WILL DO WELL IF THEY ARE WILLING TO TRY NEW METHODS OF MEETING STUDENTS' NEEDS IN OCTOBER THE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION REPORTED ON A SURVEY OF NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED LEADERS AT FOUR YEAR NON PROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THE STUDY WAS A JOINT EFFORT WITH THE GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE HURON CONSULTING GROUP THE SCHOOL OFFICIALS WERE ASKED ABOUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST ISSUES THEIR INSTITUTIONS WOULD FACE OVER THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS THEY ALSO WERE ASKED HOW WELL THEY THOUGHT THEIR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY WOULD BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THESE CHALLENGES THE STUDY IDENTIFIED THE TOP SIX ISSUES THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED LEADERS LISTED THE MOST COMMON CONCERN WAS INCREASING COMPETITION WITH OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ABOUT SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF THOSE QUESTIONED NOTED THAT CONCERN THE NEXT MOST COMMON ISSUE WAS THE DECREASING SIZE OF THE TRADITIONAL STUDENT POPULATION MEANING STUDENTS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THIRTY NINE PERCENT OF THE LEADERS LISTED THE GROWING NUMBERS OF NON TRADITIONAL STUDENTS INCLUDING ADULTS WITH FULL TIME JOBS TWO OTHER CONCERNS WERE SHRINKING STATE AND FEDERAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND DECREASING PUBLIC TRUST IN HIGHER EDUCATION ALSO THE OFFICIALS SAID THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT POLITICAL CONDITIONS AROUND THE WORLD AND THEIR EFFECT ON INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES TO CHANGES IN THE STUDENT POPULATION THE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS FELT LIKE THEY HAVE SOME ANSWERS IN FACT EIGHTY NINE PERCENT EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE IN THEIR SCHOOL'S ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GROWING NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE WORKING ADULTS PETER STOKES ARGUES THIS IS BECAUSE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DEALING WITH CHANGE STOKES IS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WITH HURON WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY REAL CONSISTENCY IN STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION THE DEGREES THAT ARE DELIVERED THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE BEING SERVICED SO THERE'S CONTINUAL CHANGE HE TOLD VOA STOKES ADDED THAT AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THERE WAS A SHARP JUMP IN THE U S BIRTH RATE LEADING TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE GOING TO COLLEGE THEN AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE BIRTH RATE DROPPED AROUND THAT TIME THE NUMBER OF WORKING ADULTS STARTING OR RETURNING TO HIGHER EDUCATION BEGAN RISING THE TRADITIONAL STUDENT POPULATION WILL LIKELY RECOVER EVENTUALLY STOKES SAYS UNTIL THEN SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH MANY HAVE ALREADY STARTED DOWN OF USING NONTRADITIONAL METHODS TO DELIVER HIGHER EDUCATION THIS INCLUDES INCREASING INTERNET BASED AND SHORT TERM PROGRAMS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE LESS TIME AND MONEY TO SPEND AS FOR THE FIVE OTHER ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE STUDY PLENTY OF CONCERNS REMAIN NO MORE THAN SEVEN LEADERS FELT VERY CONFIDENT IN THEIR SCHOOL'S ABILITY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO ANY OF THE ISSUES LOUIS SOARES IS THE CHIEF LEARNING OFFICER AT THE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION HE SAYS THAT IN RECENT YEARS AMERICANS HAVE COME TO THINK OF HIGHER EDUCATION AS MORE OF A MEANS OF GETTING A WELL PAYING JOB THAN AS A PUBLIC GOOD THIS MAY NOT BE SURPRISING GIVEN THE INCREASED COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION BUT SOARES SAYS THAT THIS PUT MANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN COMPETITION WITH ONE ANOTHER TO PROVE HOW THEIR PROGRAMS CAN AFFECT BETTER CAREER RESULTS AT THE SAME TIME U S BASED COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON AND GOOGLE ARE CREATING THEIR OWN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO COMPETE WITH TRADITIONAL DEGREE PROGRAMS AND COUNTRIES LIKE FRANCE CANADA AND AUSTRALIA ARE BECOMING MORE APPEALING TO INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WHO WOULD HAVE LIKELY LOOKED TO U S SCHOOLS IN THE PAST AS A RESULT SOME COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN CLOSING THE U S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION REPORTS THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS NATIONWIDE DROPPED TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT SOARES SUGGESTS THAT SCHOOLS HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVING IF THEY WORK TOGETHER AS GEORGIA TECH HAS SHARING NEW PROGRAM IDEAS AND METHODS WITH FIFTY OTHER INSTITUTIONS BUT THAT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY U S HIGHER EDUCATION IS INNOVATIVE BUT THE INNOVATION TENDS TO BE SMALL SCALE HE SAID LYNN PASQUERELLA SAYS WHAT MIGHT BE MORE IMPORTANT IS WORKING ON THE ISSUES AROUND PUBLIC TRUST AND GOVERNMENTAL SUPPORT OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND SHE SUGGESTS THE TWO ISSUES ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED PASQUERELLA IS PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES SHE SAYS U S HIGHER EDUCATION HAS DONE A POOR JOB OF SHOWING THAT WHAT GOES ON AT AN INSTITUTION IS VERY IMPORTANT MANY PEOPLE HAVE COME TO THINK OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AS PLACES WHERE STUDENTS WASTE TIME LEARNING UNNECESSARY SUBJECTS OR HEARING ONE SIDED BELIEFS BUT MANY STUDENTS GO ON TO BECOME BUSINESS AND POLITICAL LEADERS WHO SHAPE POLICIES IN HOPES OF IMPROVING LIVING CONDITIONS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND NATIONWIDE AND MAJOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS USUALLY START OUT IN A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY LABORATORY DEMONSTRATING THE WAYS IN WHICH THEIR SUCCESS IS INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO THE PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY'RE LOCATED AND WHICH THEY SEEK TO SERVE IS A FIRST AND CRITICAL STEP IN HELPING TO RESTORE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION NOTED PASQUERELLA SHE ADDS THAT AS AMERICANS DEVELOP A BETTER OPINION OF THE SCHOOLS STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS WILL HAVE LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO SUPPORT THEM I'M DOROTHY GUNDY AND I'M PETE MUSTO

voa-ac5a3932-ee7e-42af-a775-eccdbef114803 ONE YEAR AGO THE CAMPUSES OF AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WERE EMPTY MOST STUDENTS WERE SENT HOME IN MARCH AND DID NOT RETURN FOR MONTHS THE NEW CORONAVIRUS FORCED SCHOOLS TO TEACH USING THE INTERNET AND VIDEO CALL BUT IT WAS NOT JUST TEACHING THAT CHANGED THE GRADUATION CEREMONY OR COMMENCEMENT CHANGED TOO STUDENTS WHO HAD SPENT FOUR YEARS TAKING CLASSES TOGETHER WATCHED THE CEREMONY ON THEIR COMPUTERS FROM HOME THERE WAS NO THROWING OF HATS IN THE AIR TO CELEBRATE THE COMPLETION OF FOUR YEARS OF STUDY THERE WERE NO GROUP PHOTOS OR SHARED TEARS WHILE SAYING GOODBYE TO FRIENDS AND PROFESSORS IN A NORMAL GRADUATION CEREMONY STUDENTS GET THEIR DIPLOMA AND A HANDSHAKE FROM A UNIVERSITY LEADER IN TWENTY TWENTY THEY SAW THEIR NAME AND PERHAPS THEIR PHOTO ON A COMPUTER SCREEN IT WAS NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED WHEN THEY STARTED SCHOOL FOUR YEARS EARLIER AT THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE MOST U S UNIVERSITIES WERE GOING TO HAVE A VIDEO AND COMPUTER BASED GRADUATION BUT AS MORE PEOPLE STARTED TO GET THE COVID NINETEEN VACCINE AND THE NUMBER OF NEW VIRUS CASES DROPPED DURING THE SPRING THEY DECIDED TO CHANGE THEIR PLANS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH IN PENNSYLVANIA SAM KELLY AND KELLY SCHANES WENT TO THEIR UNIVERSITY'S GRADUATION ON MAY FOURTH THE GUEST SPEAKER VIA VIDEO WAS REBECCA SKLOOT A SCIENCE WRITER AND A UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH GRADUATE HER BOOK THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS WAS ABOUT A VACCINE THAT HELPED THE WORLD OVERCOME ILLNESS IT TOLD THE STORY OF A BLACK WOMAN WHOSE CELLS WERE USED TO CREATE A VACCINE FOR POLIO LACKS DIED WITHOUT GETTING CREDIT FOR HER GIFT TO SCIENCE SCHANES SAID THE EVENT WHILE DIFFERENT WAS A LOT BETTER IN PERSON IT WAS VERY EXCITING AND IT DID DEFINITELY MAKE IT FEEL MORE CONCRETE WE GOT TO DRESS UP IN OUR CAP AND GOWNS AND LIKE TAKE PICTURES WITH ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AND STUFF SO IT WAS DEFINITELY BETTER THAN THE TWENTY TWENTY EXPERIENCE I THINK KELLY PLAYED IN THE SCHOOL'S MARCHING BAND FOR FOUR YEARS HE WAS HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE GRADUATION CEREMONY THIS YEAR HOWEVER HE REGRETS MISSING ONE TRADITION IN HIS LAST YEAR OF SCHOOL THE UNIVERSITY IS KNOWN AS PITT SO AT THE LAST FOOTBALL GAME THE MEMBERS OF THE BAND TRADITIONALLY FORM THE LETTERS P I T T ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD ALL OF THE MEMBERS EXCEPT THOSE ABOUT TO GRADUATE WHO ARE CALLED SENIORS LEAVE THE FIELD THOSE REMAINING RECEIVE CHEERS FROM EVERYONE IN THE STANDS KELLY HOPES THAT MAYBE ONE DAY HE WILL GET A CHANCE TO RE LIVE THE TRADITION OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERYBODY IS INVOLVED IN A STUDENT ORGANIZATION WHERE THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOME SENSE OF CLOSURE BUT IN MY INSTANCE IT WILL BE NICE TO COME BACK IN THE FALL AND GET THAT ACROSS TOWN FROM PITT IS CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY THE UNIVERSITY IS KNOWN FOR MATH COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND ROBOTICS ON MAY FOURTEENTH STUDENTS WEARING THEIR GRADUATION CLOTHING WALKED THE SUNNY CAMPUS AND TOOK PICTURES WITH FRIENDS OTHERS WORKED TO TEACH A ROBOT HOW TO STUDY TREES SOME WERE PLAYING A BALL GAME EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD FINISHED THEIR WORK FOR THE YEAR THEY WERE STILL IN PITTSBURGH BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY'S GRADUATION WAS ONE WEEK AWAY ON MAY TWENTY SECOND AND TWENTY THIRD CINDY CRIMMINS IS A VICE PRESIDENT AT CARNEGIE MELLON SHE SAID THE SCHOOL IS DOING ITS BEST TO KEEP THE CEREMONY AS CLOSE TO NORMAL AS POSSIBLE WE FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT WE FEEL LIKE GIVING THE STUDENTS AN IN PERSON EXPERIENCE EVEN IF THEY CAN'T HAVE GUESTS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THEM BENJAMIN ASH FROM ATLANTA GEORGIA WAS ENJOYING THE WARM WEATHER WITH FRIENDS HE SAID YOU REALLY ONLY GET THE CHANCE TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE ONCE THAT IS WHY HE AND HIS FRIENDS WERE WAITING FOR THE CEREMONY INSTEAD OF GOING HOME I THINK WE'RE JUST EXCITED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT THIS YEAR ACROSS THE U S MANY COLLEGES WERE WORKING TO GIVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO THEIR STUDENTS ON MAY FOURTEENTH BOSTON UNIVERSITY'S STUDENTS SAT APART FROM EACH OTHER AND WORE FACE COVERINGS BUT THEY WERE TOGETHER FOR GRADUATION THEY LISTENED TO AYANNA PRESSLEY THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO REPRESENT MASSACHUSETTS IN THE U S CONGRESS SHE TALKED ABOUT THE LESSONS SHE LEARNED FROM CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JR AND OTHERS SHE TOLD THE STUDENTS THEY NEED TO IMAGINE A BETTER WORLD AND THEN WORK FOR IT NOUBAR AFEYAN IS ONE OF THE CO FOUNDERS OF MODERNA THE COMPANY THAT CREATED ONE OF THE SUCCESSFUL COVID NINETEEN VACCINES HE TOLD THE BOSTON UNIVERSITY ADVANCED GRADUATES THAT THEY WERE PIONEERS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY HAD TO FIND A NEW WAY TO LEARN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA NOT ALL OF THE SPEAKERS WERE THERE IN PERSON DR ANTHONY FAUCI TALKED TO THE STUDENTS BY VIDEO HE TOLD THEM TO BE READY FOR A DIFFICULT FUTURE WITH THE CHANGES BROUGHT ON BY THE PANDEMIC BUT HE SAID THEIR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL GAVE HIM CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL THRIVE CRIMMINS THE CARNEGIE MELLON VICE PRESIDENT SAID IT IS IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS TO GET THAT FEELING OF COMPLETION AND SATISFACTION AFTER FOUR YEARS OF HARD WORK AS A RESULT THE UNIVERSITY PROMISED THE GRADUATES FROM THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO COME BACK TO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO GRADUATION FOR THE FULL EXPERIENCE WE DON'T HAVE IT ALL WORKED OUT YET BUT IT WILL BE A FULL COMMENCEMENT CRIMMINS SAID I'M DAN FRIEDELL

voa-b2784b9a-2afc-4b91-af2c-b525e059d9673 BUSINESSMAN CHARLES MUNGER RECENTLY GAVE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SANTA BARBARA KNOWN AS UCSB TO HELP PAY FOR A NEW STUDENT LIVING SPACE AT COLLEGES STUDENTS LIVE IN BUILDINGS CALLED DORMITORIES OR DORMS FOR SHORT WHEN COMPLETE THE BUILDING WILL BE CALLED MUNGER HALL THE UNIVERSITY HOPES TO OPEN THE DORM IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE SCHOOL IS IN SANTA BARBARA A SMALL CITY ON THE PACIFIC COAST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY KILOMETERS NORTH OF LOS ANGELES IF THE PLAN CONTINUES BASED ON CURRENT DESIGNS IT WILL BE ELEVEN FLOORS HIGH AND PROVIDE BEDS FOR FOR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS ON A SMALL PIECE OF LAND MOST OF THE SLEEPING AREAS FOR STUDENTS WILL NOT HAVE WINDOWS THE BUILDING ONLY HAS ONE LARGE ENTRANCE ON EACH SIDE THE DORM IS CLOSE TO THE SCHOOL'S SPORTS FIELDS BUT FAR FROM THE REST OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE COAST WITH SO MANY STUDENTS THERE IT WOULD BE THE EIGHTH MOST DENSELY POPULATED LIVING AREA IN THE WORLD SIMILAR TO A PART OF DHAKA BANGLADESH THE BUILDING PLAN BECAME PUBLICLY KNOWN RECENTLY MANY PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED BY THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND THE LACK OF WINDOWS SAID MATT POLDBERG HE HAS ALREADY COMPLETED HIS STUDIES AT UCSB HE SAID ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF GOING TO SCHOOL IN SANTA BARBARA IS CLOSENESS TO THE OCEAN AND BEAUTIFUL AREAS NOT HAVING WINDOWS SEEMED STRANGE HE SAID AND BEING ON A PIECE OF LAND FAR AWAY FROM THE BEST PARTS OF THE SCHOOL WAS STRANGE TOO YOU KNOW TO BUILD SUCH A WINDOWLESS JOYLESS SEEMING PLACE IT SEEMED LIKE A WASTE TO NOT HAVE IT AT LEAST BE LIKE TEN STEPS FROM THE BEACH LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IS THERE MUNGER SAID THE DESIGN PUTS MORE IMPORTANCE ON PUBLIC SPACES HE WANTS STUDENTS TO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME AWAY FROM SLEEPING AREAS SO THEY CAN MEET EACH OTHER AND WORK TOGETHER THE BUILDING WILL HAVE LARGE COOKING EATING AND GATHERING SPACES THE PROJECT WAS NOT GETTING MUCH ATTENTION UNTIL OCTOBER WHEN ONE OF ITS ARCHITECTS DROPPED OUT CALLING IT DISTURBING DENNIS MCFADDEN WROTE A LETTER ON OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH CALLING THE PROJECT DESTRUCTIVE TO THE CAMPUS AND THE DESIGN UNSUPPORTABLE HE SAID HE WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE GROUP OF ADMINISTRATORS AND PROFESSORS STUDYING THE PROJECT DID NOT OBJECT HE SAID THE BUILDING WAS A RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM STUDENT HOUSING STANDARDS NEWS ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE NEW YORK TIMES CNN AND THE GUARDIAN ALL WROTE ABOUT MCFADDEN'S CONCERNS SOME CALLED THE PROJECT DORMZILLA AFTER THE JAPANESE MOVIE MONSTER GODZILLA MUNGER ANSWERED THE CRITICISM IN EARLY NOVEMBER HE TALKED WITH ARCHITECTURAL RECORD ABOUT THE PROJECT HE SAID THE ROOMS WITHOUT WINDOWS ARE QUITE ENDURABLE AND COMPARED THEM TO THE ROOMS ON LARGE VACATION BOATS KNOWN AS CRUISE SHIPS THAT DO NOT LOOK ONTO THE WATER HE CALLED THE BUILDING'S DESIGN SAFE AND ABLE TO MEET BUILDING REQUIREMENTS IN CALIFORNIA HE SAID HE THINKS UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE UNITED STATES WILL BUILD MORE BUILDINGS LIKE MUNGER HALL THE UCSB DESIGN IS SIMILAR TO A PROJECT MUNGER FUNDED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN STUDENTS HAVE MIXED OPINIONS ABOUT IT UCSB LIKE MUCH OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH LOW COST HOUSING THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE IN SANTA BARBARA THAN THE NUMBER OF HOMES AVAILABLE THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR A UNIVERSITY WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS ATMIKA IYER WRITES FOR THE DAILY NEXUS A STUDENT NEWSPAPER AT UCSB SHE SAID THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS FOR STUDENTS SOME STUDENTS MUST LIVE FAR AWAY FROM CAMPUS AND DRIVE OVER AN HOUR TO GET TO SCHOOL OTHERS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO SLEEP IN THEIR CARS RIGHT NOW THE UNIVERSITY PAYS HOTELS SO STUDENTS CAN LIVE THERE SHE SAID ONE PROBLEM IS THAT WHILE THE UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN WELCOMING MORE STUDENTS IT HAS NOT BEEN BUILDING MORE HOUSING WHILE THE SCHOOL SEES MUNGER HALL AS AN ANSWER IYER SAID MOST STUDENTS DISAGREE THE GENERAL CONSENSUS AMONG MOST OF THE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN SPEAKING WITH IS THAT THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA UCSB HOWEVER POSTED A QUESTION AND ANSWER PAGE ONLINE RECENTLY AND SAID WE EXPECT MUNGER HALL TO BE HIGHLY DESIRABLE NOLAN GRAY IS A RESEARCHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES HE STUDIES URBAN PLANNING HE RECENTLY WROTE ABOUT MUNGER HALL FOR BLOOMBERG NEWS SERVICE HE SAID THAT THE MEGA DORM WITH A COST OF OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS MAY BE UCSB'S ONLY WAY OUT OF AN EXTREME HOUSING PROBLEM BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE SO GOOD GRAY SAID SCHOOLS HAVE NO TROUBLE FINDING STUDENTS BECAUSE THE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE SO COSTLY TO LIVE IN STUDENTS OFTEN SHARE SMALL ROOMS SOME EVEN HAVE TO LEAVE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE NEAR THEIR CLASSES GRAY CALLED MUNGER HALL A TRADE OFF WHERE STUDENTS GET TO GO TO SCHOOL IN A BEAUTIFUL PLACE IN EXCHANGE FOR SLEEPING IN A SMALL WINDOWLESS ROOM LIVING IN A DORM IS NOT UNLIKE LIVING IN A SMALL APARTMENT IN A REALLY NICE CITY RIGHT WHEN YOU LIVE IN A CITY THE PARK IS YOUR LAWN THE RESTAURANTS ARE YOUR DINING ROOM THE BARS ARE YOUR PARLORS THE LIBRARY IS YOUR OFFICE GRAY SAID HE THOUGHT MUNGER HALL HAS A SIXTY FIVE OR SEVENTY PERCENT CHANCE OF BEING BUILT AT UCSB IN THE COMING YEARS THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WORK HE ADDED IYER SAID THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEM RESTS NOT ONLY WITH THE UNIVERSITY BUT WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES CLOSE TO THE UNIVERSITY ALL THREE HAVE NOT DONE A GOOD JOB OF MEETING GROWING DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND HOUSING IN ADDITION IYER SAID THERE ARE NO OTHER CURRENT PLANS FOR STUDENT HOUSING UCSB IS SORT OF PUTTING ALL THEIR EGGS IN THIS ONE BASKET RIGHT MUNGER HALL IS THE ONLY PROPOSED SOLUTION THUS FAR IF MUNGER'S PROJECT GOES AHEAD IT WILL ONLY SOLVE THE HOUSING PROBLEM FOR A SHORT TIME THE SCHOOL SAID IT IS ONLY A PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR STUDENTS POLDBERG THE UCSB GRADUATE SAID HE THINKS STUDENTS WOULD STILL RATHER GO TO SANTA BARBARA THAN TO OTHER CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS I WOULD PROBABLY PICK THE WINDOWLESS DORM HE SAID I'M DAN FRIEDELL

TWELVE GRADE LEVELS ON THE NAVAJO RESERVATION THE COVID NINETEEN DEATH RATE HAS BEEN HIGHER THAN ANY U S STATE SO AS SOME U S SCHOOLS REOPENED FOR IN PERSON LEARNING THIS FALL THOSE ON THE NAVAJO RESERVATION DID NOT UNLIKE THEIR STUDENTS PIÃ±ON HIGH SCHOOL'S TEACHERS REPORT TO WORK IN PERSON EACH DAY THEY ARE CAREFUL TO WEAR FACE COVERINGS AND STAY AS SOCIALLY DISTANT AS POSSIBLE SCIENCE TEACHER JAMES GUSTAFSON SAYS STUDENT PERFORMANCE IS SUFFERING THEIR MARKS ARE FAR LOWER THAN WHAT HE SAW LAST YEAR I'VE GIVEN THE STUDENTS WHO'VE TURNED NOTHING IN ''“ AND THERE'S A LOT OF THEM ''“ A ZERO HE SAID EVEN BEFORE THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS NATIVE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD THE HIGHEST DROPOUT RATES IN THE U S ONLY ABOUT SEVENTY TWO PERCENT OF NATIVE AMERICAN AND ALASKA NATIVE STUDENTS COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT THE NATIONAL CAUCUS OF NATIVE AMERICAN STATE LEGISLATORS SAYS THE STATE OF EDUCATION FOR K THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS FOR NATIVE STUDENTS IS WORRISOME

CONNECTIONS AND THOSE ONLY ON CELLPHONES HIGH SPEED INTERNET SERVICE IS FOUND IN ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF HOMES ON THE RESERVATION LESS THAN HALF OF THE HOMES HAVE A COMPUTER FEDERAL DATA SHOWS REACHING STUDENTS WITH NO CONNECTION AT ALL HAS BEEN A SERIOUS ISSUE OSTGAARD SAID ENROLLMENT ACROSS THE THREE SCHOOLS HAS DECREASED BY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS FROM LAST YEAR SOME HE SAID HAVE DISAPPEARED BASICALLY SEVERAL TIMES EACH WEEK THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SENDS OUT BUSES FILLED WITH PAPER SCHOOLWORK FOR STUDENTS TO PICK UP WITH FEDERAL AID FOR COVID NINETEEN THE DISTRICT GOT FOURTEEN BUSES EQUIPPED WITH WI FI INTERNET THE BUSES TRAVEL UP TO AN HOUR OFTEN ON DIRT ROADS THEY SIT IN A PLACE WHERE FAMILIES CAN DRIVE CLOSE SO STUDENTS CAN USE THE INTERNET FOR THEIR SCHOOLWORK ABOUT TWENTY

ALMOST FINISHED WITH HIGH SCHOOL SHE DREAMS OF ATTENDING A UNIVERSITY AND TO ONE DAY WORK FOR THE U S FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION BUT SHE SAID IT HAS BEEN HARD TO FILL OUT UNIVERSITY APPLICATIONS WITHOUT HER SCHOOL ADVISOR CHENOA SAYS SHE HAS A BETTER SUPPORT SYSTEM THAN MANY OF HER FRIENDS BUT EVEN SO THE FAMILY'S HOME INTERNET IS TOO WEAK TO DOWNLOAD LARGE DOCUMENTS OR CONNECT TO VIDEO PROGRAMMING SO THEY SPEND ABOUT TWENTY HOURS A WEEK IN THEIR CAR NEAR THE WI FI SCHOOL BUS AT LUNCHTIME DRIVERS OF THE WI FI BUSES FIND OUT HOW MANY MEALS THE GATHERED CHILDREN NEED DURING THE PANDEMIC THE SCHOOL HAS BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER TAKE HOME BREAKFASTS AND LUNCHES FOR FAMILIES SOME DAYS THEY GIVE OUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MEALS RESEARCH IN MAY SHOWED THAT SCHOOL SETBACKS DURING THE PANDEMIC WOULD LIKELY BE WORSE FOR CHILDREN OF COLOR AND THOSE WHO LIVE IN POVERTY IT FOUND THAT THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THE ONES WITHOUT DEPENDABLE INTERNET GUSTAFSON THE SCIENCE TEACHER CALLS THE DIVIDE BETWEEN CHILDREN WITH AND WITHOUT INTERNET A FORM OF SEGREGATION OSTGAARD THE SUPERINTENDENT SAID THAT THE DISTRICT HAS A FEW STUDENTS THAT HE WOULD ALMOST CONSIDER HOMELESS AT THIS POINT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR PARENT OR GUARDIAN SO THEY MOVE FROM ONE FAMILY MEMBERS' HOME TO ANOTHER STILL FOR STUDENTS WITH THE RIGHT SITUATIONS PIÃ±ON'S ONLINE EFFORTS HAVE WORKED WELL IN FACT THE STATE HAS GIVEN THE DISTRICT APPROVAL TO USE ITS TEACHING METHODS TO OPEN A FULLY ONLINE HIGH SCHOOL FOR ANY ARIZONA STUDENT SO WHEN PIÃ±ON SCHOOLS DO REOPEN THEIR DOORS STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE CHOICE WHETHER TO RETURN EVEN WITH ALL THAT THEY ARE FACING PIÃ±ON OFFICIALS ARE STILL DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO INSPIRE THEIR STUDENTS ABOUT THE FUTURE GUSTAFSON FOR EXAMPLE SPOKE RECENTLY VIA ZOOM VIDEO TO A

voa-bc2a1650-750e-405c-82ac-b58f4da2998e3 PEACE EDUCATION IS A GROWING AREA OF RESEARCH AT SOME COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES PEACE EDUCATION PROGRAMS OFTEN EXPLORE SUBJECTS COVERED IN THE NEWS SUCH AS VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DURING A QUARANTINE IN JAPAN THIS WEEK REBECCA OXFORD WAS TO SPEAK AT A MEETING OF JALT THE JAPAN ASSOCIATION FOR LANGUAGE TEACHING HER SUBJECT THE LANGUAGE OF PEACE OXFORD IS PROFESSOR EMERITUS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IN THE UNITED STATES SHE SAYS THAT FOREIGN AND SECOND LANGUAGE TEACHER EDUCATORS AND THEIR STUDENTS HAVE AN IMPORTANT DUTY TO PLAY IN FOSTERING PEACE SHE ADDS PEACE IS CREATED THROUGH COMMUNICATION AND THAT COMMUNICATION IS THE MAIN GOAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHER EDUCATORS AND TEACHERS OXFORD SAYS THERE ARE SIX PARTS TO PEACE THEY ARE INNER PEACE INTERPERSONAL PEACE INTER GROUP PEACE INTERCULTURAL PEACE INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND ECOLOGICAL PEACE OR CARE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT SHE BELIEVES THESE SIX TERMS GIVE TEACHERS A COMMON BASIS ON WHICH TO TALK ABOUT CONFLICT AND WORK FOR PEACE PART OF OXFORD'S APPROACH TO THE LANGUAGE OF PEACE IS TO CHANGE SIGNS OF CONFLICT INTO RESPECT FOR THE VALUES AND HOPES OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED SHE SAYS PEACE BUILDERS SHOULD LOOK FOR THE CAUSES OF CONFLICT AND USE THIS INFORMATION TO REDUCE VIOLENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE GROUPS AND CULTURES NOT EVERYONE AGREES ON THE VALUE OF PEACE EDUCATION PROGRAMS HEATHER MILLSTONE IS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND IN AUSTRALIA SHE DID RESEARCH ON HOW PEACE PROGRAMS WORK IN AUSTRALIAN SCHOOLS MILLSTONE IDENTIFIED THREE CRITICISMS OF THE PROGRAMS ONE IS THE LACK OF EVIDENCE THAT THEY WORK ANOTHER IS HOW PEACE PROGRAMS PAY ATTENTION TO A CHILD'S RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER CHILDREN INSTEAD OF ON THE LARGER COMMUNITY MILLSTONE SAYS THIS PUTS A RESPONSIBILITY ON CHILDREN TO CREATE PEACE WHEN THE SOCIETY AROUND THEM IS VIOLENT THE THIRD CRITICISM IS THAT THE PROGRAMS DO NOT CONSIDER CULTURAL VALUES SUCH AS WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL OR A GROUP IS MORE IMPORTANT IN SOCIETY ONE UNITED STATES BASED GROUP HAS BEEN USING CRITICISMS LIKE THESE TO SHAPE ITS PEACE EDUCATION PROGRAMS TIM NATION IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PEACE LEARNING CENTER OR PLC IN INDIANAPOLIS INDIANA HE SAYS THE PLC BEGAN IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AS PART OF AMERICORPS A SERVICE PROGRAM SIMILAR TO THE U S GOVERNMENT'S PEACE CORPS HE TOLD VOA IT BEGAN WORKING WITH CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCED VIOLENCE AT HOME AND THEN MOVED TO PROGRAMS TO REDUCE VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS WE SAW GOING THROUGH WORKSHOPS ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND THEN SHARING WITH THE KIDS THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MISSING LINKS IN OUR SOCIETY WE REALIZED THAT IF YOU COULD TEACH YOUNG PEOPLE AT AN EARLY AGE THEN YOU COULD HAVE A LARGER IMPACT AND HELP KIDS SUCCEED OVER THE PAST YEAR THE PLC JOINED WITH THE TRIBES LEARNING COMMUNITY A SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING PROGRAM TRIBES OFFERS TRAINING FOR ELEMENTARY MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS AS WELL AS FOR THOSE WORKING IN AFTER SCHOOL AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS NATION SAYS THE WORK OF TRIBES IS BASED ON EVIDENCE FROM RESEARCH INTO HOW TO BUILD COMMUNITIES IN SCHOOLS AND CLASSROOMS IT'S HELPED US WITH AN EVIDENCE BASED SYSTEM THAT IS EASY TO USE FOR TEACHERS AND LESSONS THAT ARE EASY TO USE AND PROVEN TO REDUCE CONFLICTS AND INCREASE ACADEMIC PROGRESS WHILE HELPING EACH STUDENT LEARN SKILLS THAT THEY CAN USE FOR A LIFETIME THE TRIBES LEARNING COMMUNITY HAS OVER FIVE THOUSAND TRAINERS WORLDWIDE WITH PROGRAMS IN CANADA AUSTRALIA AND OTHER ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES IT ALSO OFFERS SPANISH LANGUAGE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS NATION NOTES THAT WITH THE CHANGE TO ONLINE LEARNING HELP WITH UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING IS WHAT TEACHERS NEED RIGHT NOW AND LEARNING SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING SKILLS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKED TO DO IN THE WORKFORCE WHEN WE LOSE OUT ON OUR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND COLLABORATE THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR WORKFORCE AND OUR SOCIETY HEART IS AN AID GROUP THAT PROMOTES HUMANE EDUCATION THAT IS IT IS A CHARITY PROMOTING SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING OR SEL IN A RECENT EDUCATION STORY WE REPORTED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SEL AT SOME SCHOOLS PLC TRIBES AND HEART CAME TOGETHER TO DEVELOP TOOLS FOR TEACHERS TO USE IN CLASSROOMS EVERYDAY CIRCLE CARDS ARE ONE EXAMPLE OF A SHORT ACTIVITY TEACHERS CAN ADD TO EACH CLASS IT HELPS STUDENTS LEARN THE SOCIAL SKILLS THEY NEED AT SCHOOL THE PEACE LEARNING CENTER OFFERS ANOTHER KIND OF WORKSHOP ON IMPLICIT BIAS OR MAKING STEREOTYPES ABOUT GROUPS OF PEOPLE THE PLC OFFERS THE HARVARD IMPLICIT BIAS TEST IT IS FREE AND AVAILABLE IN MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES NATION SAYS THAT AFTER TAKING THE TEST STUDENTS LEARN TO THINK ABOUT AND DEAL WITH THEIR OWN BIASES WE HELP THEM PROCESS AND REFLECT ON THEIR OWN BIASES SO THEY CAN LEARN STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THEM JING LIN IS A PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND SHE TEACHES CLASSES FOR EDUCATORS RELATED TO PEACE AND ECOLOGICAL ETHICS LIN SAYS PEACE EDUCATION PROGRAMS CAN HELP STUDENTS A LOT SOME STUDENTS HAVE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF CONFLICTS AT SCHOOL OR IN THE COMMUNITY THEY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT WORRY AND MENTAL PRESSURE STUDENTS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PEACE STUDY ABOUT PEACE BUT ALSO TO STUDY TO HAVE PEACE WITH THEMSELVES WITH THE SOCIETY AND ALSO TO STUDY TO BUILD PEACE IN OUR WORLD SO THERE ARE GREAT BENEFITS IN ALL LEVELS LIN SUGGESTS ORGANIZING GROUPS OF STUDENTS INTO TEAMS BY BIRTH MONTH THEN IN THESE GROUPS EACH PERSON TELLS THEIR LIFE STORY THIS ACTIVITY AND SIMILAR ONES CAN HELP STUDENTS COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS TO KNOW EACH PERSON AS THIS LIVING BREATHING INTERESTING PERSON TO BREAK DOWN THE STEREOTYPES PEACE EDUCATION IS HELPFUL NOT JUST FOR STUDENTS

THEY ARE MEETING THESE DEMANDS THE TEACHERS SEEMED TO AGREE ON THREE ISSUES THEY NOW FACE HOW TO HOLD THE ATTENTION OF THEIR STUDENTS PERSUADING STUDENTS TO TALK IN ENGLISH AND GETTING THEM TO WORK WITH THEIR CLASSMATES WHILE BEING IN DIFFERENT PLACES WENDY COULSON IS AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE SPECIALIST WITH THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE SHE CURRENTLY LIVES IN MEXICO COULSON IS WORKING WITH ENGLISH TEACHERS IN MYANMAR THE COUNTRY FORMERLY CALLED BURMA SHE SAYS THEY TELL HER THAT SOME STUDENTS DO NOT SPEAK UP IN CLASS BECAUSE THEY ARE THINKING OF THEIR SOCIAL POSITION SHE ADVISES THE TEACHERS TO USE A NAME WHEEL TO OVERCOME THIS THE FREE WHEEL OF NAMES ONLINE COMPUTER PROGRAM LETS A TEACHER ADD NAMES THEN MOVE A WHEEL TO CHOOSE WHICH STUDENT WILL SPEAK ONE CAN ALSO ADD WORDS OR PICTURES TO THE WHEEL COULSON SAYS SHE SOMETIMES ADDS VERBS TO GIVE STUDENTS A CHANCE TO MAKE COMPLETE SENTENCES SHE FINDS THEY REACT WELL TO COMPETITION LIKE PLAYING GAMES WITH VERBS THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO SPEAK UP WHEN SHE USES THE WHEEL I JUST FOUND OUT IT REALLY WORKED OTHERWISE THEY ARE TOO QUIET THEY ARE ALL DRAWN IN AND READY TO DO IT THEY REALLY RESPONDED TO THAT BECAUSE THEY'LL 'OH IT'S ME OK I HAVE TO SPEAK ' KIMBERLEY GAMEZ TEACHES ENGLISH LEARNERS AT CENTERVILLE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE AMERICAN STATE OF VIRGINIA SHE USES CLASSDOJO A WEBSITE TEACHERS CAN USE TO WORK WITH YOUNGER STUDENTS IT HELPS THE TEACHER CHOOSE A STUDENT TO SPEAK GAMEZ SAYS SHE ALSO USES THE WHEEL OF NAMES PROGRAM AND I'VE LEARNED THAT STUDENTS FIND THAT WAY LESS THREATENING THAN YOU JUST CHOOSING A STUDENT YOU DIDN'T REALLY CALL THEM OUT OR THEY'RE NOT BEING PUT ON THE SPOT THEY GET INTO IT A LITTLE BIT MORE MANY TEACHERS SAY THEY GET TIRED OF BEING ONLINE FOR LONG HOURS DURING THE SCHOOL DAY LANA VIKHNEVICH TEACHES ORAL COMMUNICATION CLASSES IN CHINA SHE LEARNED FROM ANOTHER TEACHER THAT SHE COULD RECORD A VIDEO TO PLAY DURING HER CLASS AND ASK STUDENTS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BASICALLY I WOULD RECORD A SHORT VIDEO AGAIN ABOUT THE TOPIC THAT WE DISCUSSED AND THEN I WOULD SEND THEM TO THE STUDENTS AND THEN I WOULD SEND THEM THE QUIZ RELATED TO THIS VIDEO THE TRICK IS MAYBE BY THEMSELVES OR IN GROUPS OF TWO OR THREE THEY HAVE TO ANSWER THAT QUIZ CORRECTLY LIKE HUNDRED PERCENT I ALSO SPOKE WITH BITA BOOKMAN WHO TEACHES AT SANTA ROSA JUNIOR COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA SHE NOTED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE CHANGE FROM IN PERSON TO ONLINE TEACHING ESL CLASSES ARE ALL ABOUT GROUP WORK RIGHT HOW DO I CREATE THAT ONLINE IT WAS A STRUGGLE BUT I DISCOVERED PLAYPOSIT AND IT'S WONDERFUL BECAUSE IT'S SO INTERACTIVE IT IS JUST LIKE STUDENTS ATTENDING A CLASS USING THE PLAYPOSIT PROGRAM BOOKMAN RECORDS SHORT VIDEOS EACH LESS THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES THEN EVERY ONE OR TWO MINUTES THE VIDEO STOPS AND THE STUDENTS HAVE TIME TO INTERACT WITH IT THAT INTERACTION COULD BE A QUESTION A CONVERSATION FOR THE STUDENTS TO CHAT WITH EACH OTHER THEY CAN WRITE AN ESSAY TYPE ANSWER PLAYPOSIT IS AVAILABLE IN THE CANVAS LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR LMS BITA BOOKMAN ALSO SAYS SHE USES MANY DISCUSSION BOARDS IN CANVAS SHE SAID HER STUDENTS KNOW ENOUGH ENGLISH TO READ DIRECTIONS AND COMPLETE THEIR HOMEWORK ONLINE WHEN SHE PUTS STUDENTS INTO GROUPS SHE TEAMS UP MORE EXPERIENCED STUDENTS WITH NEWER ONES THE EXPERIENCED STUDENTS THEN HELP EXPLAIN HOW TO USE ONLINE PROGRAMS SUCH AS GOOGLE DOCS BACK IN VIRGINIA KIMBERLY GAMEZ DOES TEAM TEACHING A METHOD WHERE TWO TEACHERS LEAD THE SAME CLASS SHE TOLD ME THAT MAKING TIME FOR PLANNING CAREFULLY TOGETHER IS NECESSARY IT IS NICE TO HAVE A SECOND PERSON IN THERE FOR THAT STUDENT WHO'S MAYBE HAVING A MAYBE LIKE A TECH ISSUE OR CAN'T FIND THE MICROPHONE OR CAN'T FIND A LINK GAMEZ ALSO USES MUSIC TO FILL THE AIR WHILE WAITING FOR STUDENTS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SO I ACTUALLY HAVE USED IN MY SLIDES BACKGROUND AUDIO FOR ME IT JUST MAKES IT FEEL LESS AWKWARD LIKE THERE'S JUST SOME MUSIC PLAYING AND IT'S OKAY THAT YOU'RE TAKING YOUR TIME I'M NOT JUST SITTING HERE AWKWARDLY WAITING FOR YOU LANA VIKHNEVICH SAYS ONE OF HER GOALS IS TO TEACH STUDENTS TO USE FEWER FILLERS AND PAUSES OR SHORT HALTS IN SPEAKING WHEN THEY SPEAK ENGLISH SHE BEGINS EACH ONLINE CLASS WITH A SHORT WARMUP ACTIVITY SUCH AS A TONGUE TWISTER ''“ A SERIES OF WORDS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO SAY QUICKLY AND CORRECTLY HER STUDENTS RECORD THEMSELVES ON A PHONE TO SHARE WITH THE CLASS AND TEACHER I WOULD GIVE THEM THE TONGUE TWISTERS AND I WOULD GIVE THEM A SPECIFIC PROSODIC FEATURE TO MASTER FOR EXAMPLE PAUSES AND THEN THEY WOULD RECORD THEY ALL RECORD THEIR SENTENCES NOTICING HOW OTHER PEERS RECORD THEIR SENTENCES AGAIN FOCUSING ON THOSE PROSODIC FEATURES BY COMPARING THEIR RECORDINGS WITH THOSE OF OTHER STUDENTS ENGLISH LEARNERS GET LISTENING TRAINING AND

AND BE PART OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS RELATED TO CHANGES AT LOCAL SCHOOLS THE DISCUSSIONS THERE LAUNCHED A MOVEMENT FOR REOPENING SCHOOLS THERE'S A LOT OF PARENTS THAT ARE SAYING 'OPEN OUR

FLORIDA THE WORKING PLAN IS FOR ALL YOUNGER STUDENTS TO RETURN TO SCHOOL FULL TIME ON AUGUST TENTH OLDER STUDENTS WOULD DEPEND ON ONLINE LEARNING WHILE THEY ARE BROUGHT BACK INTO SCHOOL BUILDINGS

voa-bed49d7e-8ce1-4695-aae9-7cb38f80adda3 THE PATH ONE TAKES AFTER EARNING A DEGREE FROM A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY IN THE UNITED STATES IS NOT AS CLEAR AS IT ONCE WAS TWO NEW STUDIES SUGGEST THAT COLLEGE GRADUATES ENTERING THE U S JOB MARKET MAY NOT WORK IN THE FIELD THEY EXPECT AND THESE MEN AND WOMEN MAY CHANGE JOBS AND EVEN INDUSTRIES MORE OFTEN THAN THEIR PARENTS EVER DID SOME EXPERTS SAY THIS BOTH PRESENTS NEW DIFFICULTIES AND OPENS UP NEW POSSIBILITIES IN AN ECONOMY THAT IS GOING THROUGH CHANGES THE FIRST STUDY IS FROM EMSI A COMPANY SPECIALIZING IN LABOR MARKET RESEARCH THE COMPANY RELEASED THE FINDINGS LAST MONTH THE EMSI STUDY WAS BASED ON AN EXAMINATION OF THE JOB HISTORIES OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION AMERICANS RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT THE FIRST THREE JOBS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO COMPLETED FOUR YEAR DEGREE PROGRAMS IN SIX FIELDS THE SIX WERE LANGUAGES AND PHILOSOPHY THE SOCIAL SCIENCES BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THE STUDY FOUND THAT MANY OF THE GRADUATES STARTED OUT WORKING IN THE FIELD THEY STUDIED IN COLLEGE FOR EXAMPLE TWENTY PERCENT OF ENGINEERING GRADUATES WORKED IN INDUSTRIAL OR MECHANICAL ENGINEERING FOR THEIR FIRST JOB YET BY THEIR THIRD JOB MANY WERE WORKING IN A COMPLETELY UNRELATED FIELD ADVERTISING SALES AND FINANCIAL RESEARCH WERE AMONG THE TOP TEN JOB OUTCOMES OR RESULTS FOR ALL SIX GROUPS IN FACT ABOUT FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF ALL JOB OUTCOMES IN THE STUDY WERE SOME FORM OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS CLARE COFFEY IS A DATA RESEARCHER AND WRITER FOR EMSI SHE TOLD VOA THAT THE STUDY DOES NOT SPEAK TO THE OUTCOMES FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS IN EVERY FIELD BUT THE FACT THAT THE SIX FIELDS IN THE STUDY ARE SO DIFFERENT AND YET HAD SIMILAR OUTCOMES DOES SUGGEST CAREER PATHS HAVE CHANGED OVERALL A LOT OF THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT WORK AND EDUCATION IS STILL LIKE 'THE JOBS ARE SCIENTISTS AND WRITER AND TEACHER ' SORT OF THIS 'WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP ' WAY OF THINKING ABOUT JOBS SAID COFFEY BUT THE AREAS WHERE THERE'S TONS OF DEMAND AND TONS OF GROWTH ARE BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT PRODUCTS FOR COMPANIES AND ALSO OVERSEE THE PROCESS BY WHICH THEY'RE DISTRIBUTED COFFEY NOTED AN IMPORTANT DETAIL TO CONSIDER IS THAT IN FIELDS LIKE THE HARD SCIENCES SUCH AS CHEMISTRY IT IS EASIER TO EXPLAIN WHAT SKILLS YOUR EDUCATION HAS GIVEN YOU SO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES NEED TO BETTER EXPLAIN TO PHILOSOPHY STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE THE VALUE IN THE SKILLS THEY GAIN SUCH AS WRITTEN COMMUNICATION AND FORMING ARGUMENTS THEN GRADUATES CAN BETTER DEMONSTRATE THEIR VALUE AS THEY MOVE FROM ONE FIELD TO ANOTHER EDWIN KOC ARGUES THAT CHANGING JOBS AND EVEN FIELDS IS SOMETHING THE CURRENT GENERATION OF COLLEGE STUDENTS WILL DEAL WITH MORE IN THE FUTURE KOC IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND EMPLOYERS HE NOTED THAT HIS DAUGHTER WHO GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN HAS HELD FOUR DIFFERENT JOBS TO DATE HE GRADUATED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE AND HAS HELD THE SAME NUMBER OF JOBS SINCE THEN PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE CURRENT U S JOB MARKET IS VERY STRONG THIS MEANS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY WITH THEIR CURRENT POSITION IT WILL LIKELY BE EASY FOR THEM TO FIND A JOB WITH BETTER PAY KOC SAID YOUNGER WORKERS ALSO HAVE LESS OF A CONNECTION TO THEIR EMPLOYERS AS THEY HAVE SEEN GROWING LIMITATIONS ON FINANCIAL BENEFITS AND EVEN JOB SECURITY THEY'VE GONE THROUGH GROWING UP DURING A PERIOD WHEN THEIR PARENTS MAY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES LOSING THEIR JOBS OR AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR JOBS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND THEY'RE CARRYING THAT OVER WITH THEM A SKEPTICISM ABOUT WHAT AN EMPLOYER WILL DO ON THEIR BEHALF SAID KOC HE SUGGESTED THAT EMPLOYERS ALSO HAVE POWER IN THE CURRENT LABOR MARKET AS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES THE SKILLS A PERSON POSSESSES UPON GRADUATING OFTEN BECOME OUTDATED WITHIN SIX YEARS AND EMPLOYERS HAVE MORE SKILLED WORKERS TO CHOOSE FROM THAN EVER BEFORE MEANING ALMOST ANYONE CAN BE REPLACED THIS LACK OF STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS IN CAREER PATHS DOES NOT JUST AFFECT GRADUATES OF FOUR YEAR DEGREE PROGRAMS SAYS HIRONAO OKAHANA HE IS ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT FOR RESEARCH AND POLICY ANALYSIS AT THE COUNCIL OF GRADUATE SCHOOLS OKAHANA AND KOC AGREE THAT IN THE PAST THE JOB OUTCOMES FOR THOSE WITH A DOCTORAL DEGREE OR PHD WERE MUCH CLEARER PHDS REQUIRE AN INTENSE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE ''“ SO MUCH EXPERTISE THAT MOST PHD HOLDERS ONCE WERE ALMOST GUARANTEED JOBS AS UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS OR RESEARCHERS IN JULY THE COUNCIL OF GRADUATE STUDIES RELEASED A STUDY LOOKING AT THE JOB OUTCOMES FOR OVER FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PHD HOLDERS ALL OF THE SUBJECTS HAD GRADUATED EITHER THREE EIGHT OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO OVERALL FEW PHD HOLDERS WHO GRADUATED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO CHANGED JOBS RECENTLY AND MOST FOUND THEIR CURRENT JOBS WITHIN THREE YEARS OF GRADUATING THIS WAS NOT THE CASE FOR PHD HOLDERS WHO GRADUATED EIGHT YEARS AGO AND WAS EVEN LESS LIKELY FOR THOSE WHO GRADUATED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS ALSO THE MAJORITY OF CAREER MOVES FOR THESE TWO GROUPS WERE AWAY FROM HIGHER EDUCATION AND INTO BUSINESS GOVERNMENT AND NON PROFIT INDUSTRIES OKAHANA SAID THIS MEANS THAT BY NO MEANS SHOULD A PHD HOLDER CONSIDER THEIR FIRST JOB AS A PERMANENT MOVE IT ALSO MEANS THAT THEY NOW HAVE THE CHANCE TO WORK IN FIELDS THAT THEY MAY NEVER HAVE CONSIDERED BEFORE BUT BECAUSE OF THIS THEY MUST TRY TO DEVELOP AS MANY SKILLS THAT ARE USEFUL IN DIFFERENT FIELDS AS THEY CAN SOME OF THE BROADER SKILLS BECOME IMPORTANT WHICH SORT OF POINTS TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION NOT JUST AS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OR JOB PREPARATION BUT MORE EDUCATION FOR THE WHOLE HUMAN SAID OKAHANA HE EDWIN KOC AND CLARE COFFEY ALL SAID THEY AGREE THAT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MUST SUPPORT STUDENTS' ABILITY TO GROW AND CHANGE THEY SHOULD DO THIS BY URGING STUDENTS TO TAKE CLASSES OUTSIDE THEIR USUAL FIELD OF STUDY AND SEEK OUT EARLY WORK EXPERIENCE IN AREAS OF INTEREST TO THEM EMPLOYERS SHOULD LOOK TO FILL POSITIONS WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE STUDIED THE SUBJECTS NORMALLY EXPECTED FOR THOSE JOBS I'M JILL ROBBINS AND I'M PETE MUSTO

IT INSTEAD USED TEMPORARY OR SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS TO WORK WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE PHYSICAL DISABILITIES OR DIFFICULTY LEARNING TANIA PROKOP IS AZTEC'S DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT SHE TELLS VOA AMERICANS WERE NOT INTERESTED IN THE FULL TIME POSITIONS AZTEC IS NOT ALONE NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY REPORTED THAT THE STATE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY UNFILLED TEACHING POSITIONS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS A STUDY FROM THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE ESTIMATES THAT NATIONWIDE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS CURRENTLY HAVE A SHORTAGE OF ONE HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND TEACHERS THIS YEAR THROUGH A PROGRAM THAT BRINGS FOREIGNERS TO TEACH IN U S SCHOOLS AZTEC HAS EIGHT FULL TIME SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS ALL OF THEM ARE FILIPINOS WITH J ONE VISAS FROM THE U S STATE DEPARTMENT THEY TEACH SOME OF THE CHILDREN WHO ATTEND THE DISTRICT'S SIX SCHOOLS AZTEC'S FILIPINO TEACHERS ARE TRAINED SPECIALISTS IN THEIR AREAS OF EXPERTISE THEY COME TO TEACH FOR THREE YEARS AND THE VISA CAN BE EXTENDED FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS THE J ONE VISA HOWEVER DOES NOT LEAD TO A GREEN CARD OR PERMANENT RESIDENCY IN THE UNITED STATES PROKOP GIVES HIGH MARKS TO THE FILIPINO TEACHERS SAYING IT HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE NOT ALL OF IT HAS BEEN EASY BOTH THE FILIPINO TEACHERS AND THE AMERICAN STUDENTS HAVE TO GET USED TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR CULTURES PROKOP SAYS MANAGING THE CLASSROOM IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THE TEACHERS HAVE HAD TO LEARN LEARNING IN THE CLASSROOM IS NOT JUST LIMITED TO READING BOOKS AND DOING HOMEWORK PROKOP SAID THAT MANY OF THE STUDENTS HAVE NEVER TRAVELED FAR FROM HOME SO TO HAVE SOMEBODY COME FROM A WHOLE DIFFERENT COUNTRY ACROSS AN OCEAN AND SHARE THOSE EXPERIENCES AND SHARE PICTURES AND SHARE STORIES AND SHARE FOOD AND WE'RE COMING UP TO SOME HOLIDAYS SO THEY'LL BE SHARING SOME DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES WITH HOLIDAYS PROKOP SAID THE COMMUNITY WELCOMED THE EIGHT FILIPINO TEACHERS AND HELPED THEM SETTLE INTO THEIR NEW HOMES RIVA ALIPIN IS ONE OF THE EIGHT SHE TEACHES MATHEMATICS '' INTEGRATED ALGEBRA

TEACHING COMING HERE TO TEACH IN AMERICA SHE SAID SHE NEEDED A LOT OF GUTS IN OTHER WORDS ONE MUST BE BRAVE ALIPIN ALSO SAID IT WAS RISKY BECAUSE NEW MEXICO IS SO FAR AWAY FROM HER HOMELAND SHE ALSO WAS CONCERNED ABOUT DISCRIMINATION THERE HAS BEEN NEWS IN MY COUNTRY THAT FILIPINO TEACHERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED NOT BY THE SCHOOL ADMIN BUT BY THE STUDENTS SHE SAID THE STUDENTS HAVE BULLIED TEACHERS FOR BEING A NON NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER FILIPINOS ARE DISCRIMINATED BECAUSE OF OUR ACCENT '' MEANING THE WAY THEY TALK BUT SHE SAID THAT MY EXPERIENCE IN AZTEC HIGH SCHOOL PROVES IT WRONG SHE SAYS THE STUDENTS ARE KIND AND RESPECTFUL SOME THINGS THE FILIPINO TEACHERS WILL NEED TO GET USED TO THE FOOD AND WEATHER AMERICANS EAT DIFFERENT FOODS IN ADDITION NEW MEXICO HAS VERY DIFFERENT WEATHER FROM THE PHILIPPINES THE EIGHT TEACHERS ARE EXCITED ABOUT WINTER SINCE IT WILL BE THEIR FIRST SNOW ALIPIN FOUND HER JOB THROUGH A BUSINESS CALLED BEPAUCHE INTERNATIONAL LLC CHERYL MARIE MAGHINAY IS CO OWNER OF THE COMPANY SHE LEFT THE PHILIPPINES AND MOVED TO THE UNITED STATES OVER TEN YEARS AGO TO ACCEPT A JOB AS A TEACHER IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SHE LAUNCHED HER COMPANY TO HELP OTHER

START IN THEIR NEW POSITIONS SHE SAID IT IS NOT EASY FOR THEM WHEN THEY FIRST ARRIVE BUT SHE ADDS THAT THE FOREIGN TEACHER PROGRAM INCREASES UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES I SEE THE BENEFITS AND I SEE THE BEAUTY IN DIVERSITY YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE COME TOGETHER AND LEARN TOGETHER DIFFERENT PRACTICES AND ALSO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EACH OTHER'S CULTURE IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY NICE THE U S STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO FOREIGN TEACHERS WERE GIVEN EXCHANGE VISAS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE COUNTRIES SENDING THE MOST TEACHERS WERE THE PHILIPPINES SPAIN JAMAICA CHINA AND FRANCE THE TOP FIVE STATES WITH THE MOST FOREIGN TEACHERS WERE NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA NEW MEXICO TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA IN ILLINOIS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT TEACHERS FROM SPAIN WORK

TEACHERS WHO SPEAK ENGLISH AND CAN TEACH IN AREAS OF NEED BUT SHE CALLED IT A SHORT TERM SOLUTION WHILE ISBE CONTINUES TO SUPPORT 'GROW OUR OWN' TEACHER PROGRAMS WHAT IS CAUSING THE SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS MATTHEWS SAID AMERICANS GIVE DIFFERENT REASONS INCLUDING PAY PENSIONS AND WORKING CONDITIONS THE ISBE SAYS ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT EDUCATORS ARE NOT ALWAYS BEING PREPARED TO TEACH SUBJECTS

voa-bfa11dc8-95e6-40b3-8e8a-6089ca127a153 A RECENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES HELPS WHITE PEOPLE MORE FINANCIALLY THAN IT DOES OTHER GROUPS THE FINDING MAKES SOME EDUCATION EXPERTS QUESTION THE EFFECTIVENESS OF U S EFFORTS TO FIGHT RACIAL INJUSTICE AT THE SAME TIME OTHER EXPERTS NOTE THAT SYSTEMIC INEQUALITY AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE UNITED STATES LAST OCTOBER THE GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY CENTER ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE PUBLISHED A STUDY ON U S COLLEGE GRADUATES RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT THE EARNINGS OF WHITE BLACK AND LATINO AMERICANS WHO HAD EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN OVER THAT PERIOD BLACKS AND LATINOS WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE INCREASED THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING AND KEEPING A GOOD PAYING JOB THE GEORGETOWN RESEARCHERS DEFINED SUCH A POSITION AS ONE PAYING AT LEAST THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BUT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES HELD SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE GOOD PAYING JOBS THESE MEN AND WOMEN REPRESENTED SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF AVAILABLE JOB HOLDERS NATIONWIDE THE STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT WHITES HOLDING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND WORKING IN A GOOD JOB EARNED ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE A YEAR THAN BLACKS AND LATINOS WITH THE SAME EDUCATION ANTHONY CARNAVALE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE GEORGETOWN CENTER HE DESCRIBES THE FINDINGS AS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF AMERICA'S LONG HISTORY OF TREATING MINORITIES UNEQUALLY THE FIRST BLACKS TO ARRIVE IN NORTH AMERICA CAME AS SLAVES EVEN AFTER THE UNITED STATES BANNED SLAVERY MANY SOUTHERN STATES CREATED JIM CROW LAWS THESE RULES BARRED AFRICAN AMERICANS FROM MANY SCHOOLS AND FIELDS OF EMPLOYMENT CARNAVALE TOLD VOA THAT CONDITIONS FOR BLACK AMERICANS IMPROVED SOMEWHAT OVER THE YEARS BUT FOLLOWING WORLD WAR TWO MANY WHITES MOVED OUT OF MAJOR U S CITIES THANKS IN PART TO THE FINANCIAL AID THEY RECEIVED FOR THEIR MILITARY SERVICE THIS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR MAJORITY WHITE COMMUNITIES TO BUILD LARGE TAX BASES WHICH HELPED FINANCE STRONG PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS HE SAID THIS THEN MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR MORE WHITES TO ATTEND COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CARNAVALE ADDED THAT LATINOS DID NOT BECOME A MAJOR PART OF THE U S ECONOMY UNTIL THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HE SAID THEY FACED MUCH THE SAME DISCRIMINATION AS BLACKS IN MORE RECENT TIMES THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO HIGHER EDUCATION ESPECIALLY FOR MINORITIES FOR THE MOST PART HOWEVER THIS HAS MEANT SENDING BLACK LATINO AND POOR STUDENTS TO TWO AND FOUR YEAR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES STATE GOVERNMENTS GIVE FAR LESS FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THESE SCHOOLS THAN THEY USED TO NOTED CARNAVALE THIS MEANS MANY OF THE SCHOOLS STRUGGLE TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AS BEST THEY CAN SO WE'VE CREATED MORE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION IN AMERICA BUT WE HAVE NOT CREATED MUCH MORE SUCCESS HE SAID THE SUCCESS THE GRADUATION RATES ARE HIGHEST BY FAR FOR AFFLUENT WHITE KIDS VICTOR GOODE ARGUES THAT THE INEQUALITY ISSUE GOES BEYOND EDUCATION AND EXTENDS INTO MANY OTHER AREAS OF AMERICAN LIFE GOODE IS THE EDUCATION DIRECTOR FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE OR NAACP A U S BASED CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP TO DATE THE U S GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO FACE PROBLEMS IN DEALING WITH INEQUALITY IN MANY AREAS SAYS GOODE IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE U S COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS REPORTED A LACK OF RESOURCES FOR ANTI DISCRIMINATION EFFORTS AT THIRTEEN FEDERAL AGENCIES IT FOUND THAT THESE AGENCIES LACKED THE MONEY TO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS OF DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND VOTING GOODE ADDS THAT A LITTLE OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE U S SUPREME COURT RULED STATES COULD NOT PREVENT BLACK STUDENTS FROM ATTENDING THE SAME SCHOOLS AS WHITES BUT THIS YEAR A NEW JERSEY JUDGE AGREED TO CONSIDER A COURT CASE AGAINST THE STATE'S PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THE NAACP AND OTHER GROUPS HAVE ACCUSED THE STATE OF SEGREGATION BASED ON RACE AND EARNINGS THE NAACP IS HAS ALSO TAKEN LEGAL ACTION TO DEMAND GREATER FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS FROM STATE GOVERNMENTS IN MARYLAND DELAWARE AND MINNESOTA STATES NEED TO SEE HOW THEY CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF PROVIDING AN ADEQUATE EQUITABLE EDUCATION TO ALL STUDENTS NOTED GOODE WHILE EVERY COUNTRY IS DIFFERENT THIS KIND OF INEQUALITY EXISTS IN MANY MAJORITY WHITE NATIONS SAYS KYRIAKI TOPIDI SHE IS A RESEARCHER WITH THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR MINORITY ISSUES TOPIDI NOTES THAT IN GERMANY MANY RECENT AFRICAN AND MIDDLE EASTERN IMMIGRANTS LACK ACCESS TO HIGH SCHOOLS WITH ADVANCED STUDY PROGRAMS AND STUDIES SHOWED THAT EMPLOYERS IN BRITAIN WERE SIXTY PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO CONSIDER WHITE CANDIDATES FOR EMPLOYMENT THAN BLACKS OR SOUTH ASIANS TOPIDI SUGGESTS ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS BY WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CREATE ANTI DISCRIMINATION POLICIES ALSO SHE SAID LEADERS SHOULD TRY TO GET MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT RACES AND ECONOMIC LEVELS TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BETTER THROUGH COMMUNITY BUILDING EVENTS AND TRAINING THIS PROCESS SHOULD BE BASED ON THE ACCEPTANCE THAT PEOPLE DO NOT SIMPLY REPRESENT 'ETHNICITIES' OR 'RACES ' BUT RATHER ARE COMPLEX BEINGS THAT ALSO DIFFER ACCORDING TO SOCIAL STATUS INTERESTS PROFESSION BELIEFS SHE SAID YET ANTHONY CARNAVALE IS NOT HOPEFUL THAT CONDITIONS FOR BLACKS AND LATINOS WILL IMPROVE IN THE UNITED STATES ANY TIME SOON HE SAYS THAT UNLESS WEALTHY WHITE AMERICANS ARE WILLING TO SPEND MUCH MORE IN TAXES TO SUPPORT PUBLIC EDUCATION THINGS WILL LIKELY REMAIN THE SAME FOR THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS I'M DOROTHY GUNDY AND I'M PETE MUSTO

voa-caefeb72-de70-488c-aa8f-6e0ca52dcfb83 WOULD YOU TURN DOWN A TOP NATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOR A HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY OR HBCU IN THE UNITED STATES NIKOLE HANNAH JONES DID HANNAH JONES IS THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNING WRITER WHO CREATED THE NEW YORK TIMES' SIXTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT SHE WAS RECENTLY OFFERED A JOB AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL UNC THE SCHOOL IS ONE OF THE TOP NATIONAL UNIVERSITIES THE OFFER CAME WITHOUT TENURE A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT FOR A PROFESSOR THE DECISION BROUGHT CRITICISM AND PROTESTS IN EARLY JULY UNC LEADERS CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND VOTED TO AWARD TENURE TO HANNAH JONES BUT INSTEAD SHE ACCEPTED A TEACHING POSITION AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY AN HBCU IN WASHINGTON D C ON THE SAME DAY HOWARD ALSO ANNOUNCED THE APPOINTMENT OF BEST SELLING WRITER TA NEHISI COATES COATES WROTE ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE AS A YOUNG BLACK MAN GROWING UP IN BALTIMORE MARYLAND HIS TWENTY FIFTEEN BOOK BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME WON A NATIONAL BOOK AWARD HOWARD IS ONE OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES RECOGNIZED BY THE U S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HBCUS STARTED AS A PLACE TO EDUCATE AFRICAN AMERICANS AS THEY CONTINUED TO BE BARRED FROM MOST UNIVERSITIES AFTER THE CIVIL WAR THE LATE U S PRESIDENT GEORGE H W BUSH ONCE SAID AT A TIME WHEN MANY SCHOOLS BARRED THEIR DOORS TO BLACK AMERICANS THESE COLLEGES OFFERED THE BEST AND OFTEN THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY FOR A HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE SOUTHERN STATE OF LOUISIANA THE STATE'S UNIVERSITY LOUISIANA STATE IN BATON ROUGE OPENED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY BUT THE SCHOOL DID NOT ACCEPT BLACK STUDENTS UNTIL THE EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES SO BLACKS COULD ONLY CONTINUE THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION AT SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY ALSO IN BATON ROUGE WHICH OPENED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY MOST HBCUS LIE IN THE AREA FROM SOUTHERN TEXAS TO EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA WHILE MOST STUDENTS ARE BLACK ANYONE CAN GO TO AN HBCU THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS REPORTED THAT NON BLACKS MADE UP TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF

UNIVERSITY AS ONE OF THE BEST HBCUS AMONG TOP NATIONAL UNIVERSITIES HOWEVER HOWARD IS RATED AS THE EIGHTIETH BEST AS COMPARED TO TWENTY EIGHTH FOR UNC SO MOREHOUSE AND HOWARD I THINK ARE KIND OF

SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS HE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT THE CURRENT AID IS A ONCE IN A GENERATION CHANCE FOR HIS SCHOOLS TO MAKE SERIOUS INVESTMENTS BUT THE SPENDING DECISIONS CARRY RISKS IF IMPORTANT NEEDS GET LITTLE ATTENTION SCHOOLS COULD BE CRITICIZED BY THEIR COMMUNITIES AND POLITICIANS WHO INFLUENCE THEIR FUNDING THEY COULD ALSO FACE CRITICISM IF THE MONEY DOES NOT BRING MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS AT THE SAME TIME SCHOOLS MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO TAKE ON COSTS THEY CANNOT PAY FOR IN THE LONG TERM EDUCATION SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA SAID THE AID LETS SCHOOLS DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT HAVE HURT THE NATION'S EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME HE SAID SCHOOLS CAN TRAIN TEACHERS IN SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND WORK TO END RACIAL INEQUITIES IN EDUCATION WITH SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OUR

DISTRICTS QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT FUTURE FINANCES SOME STATES HAVE CUT EDUCATION BUDGETS BECAUSE THEY HAVE LESS INCOME OTHER STATES ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW TO KEEP FUTURE COSTS UNDER CONTROL MANY SCHOOLS ARE AVOIDING BIG HIRING INCREASES INSTEAD MANY WILL CONSIDER ADDING TEACHERS UNDER SHORT TERM AGREEMENTS OR HIRING CONTRACTORS TO DO SOCIAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN VIRGINIA BEACH OFFICIALS ARE CONSIDERING WHETHER TO ADD TEACHERS UNDER ONE YEAR CONTRACTS THEY ARE INTERESTED IN HIRING RETIREES OR OTHERS WITHOUT TEACHING EXPERIENCE THE DISTRICT IS ALSO EXPLORING WHETHER TO TRAIN CURRENT

IT STARTED WITH A WHITE COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSOR TALKING ABOUT SMALL WORDS OR SOUNDS THAT PEOPLE USE WHILE SPEAKING TO SIGNAL PAUSES BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS HEALTH CRISIS GREGORY PATTON WAS TEACHING THE CLASS ONLINE IN A VIDEO CONFERENCE THIS FACT MAY HAVE ADDED TO THE PROBLEM PATTON ADVISED HIS BUSINESS SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP THE PAUSES BUT SHOULD AVOID THESE FILLER SOUNDS UM AND ER ARE EXAMPLES OF THESE SOUNDS IN ENGLISH IN THE MANDARIN CHINESE LANGUAGE PATTON SAID THE WORD PEOPLE OFTEN USE TO FILL SPACE BETWEEN THOUGHTS IS THAT THE WORD IS PRONOUNCED NE GA WHICH SOUNDS LIKE AN ENGLISH WORD THAT IS OFFENSIVE TO BLACK PEOPLE IT IS KNOWN AS THE N WORD AND IS USED TO MAKE BLACK PEOPLE FEEL LESS THAN HUMAN MANY STUDENTS WERE SURPRISED TO HEAR THE SOUND COME FROM A PROFESSOR SOME BLACK STUDENTS WERE UPSET AND SENT A LETTER TO THE SCHOOL EXPRESSING THEIR DISPLEASURE THEY SAID THE PROFESSOR SHOULD HAVE WARNED THEM THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY A WORD THAT SOUNDED LIKE A BAD WORD IN ENGLISH PATTON HOWEVER SAID HE HAD USED THE EXAMPLE IN CLASSES BEFORE WITHOUT COMPLAINT SO HE DID NOT THINK ABOUT WARNING STUDENTS TOM BARTLETT WROTE A STORY ABOUT THE INCIDENT FOR THE CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION HE SAID THE COMPLAINTS LED TO PATTON BEING REMOVED FROM THE CLASS FOR THE REST OF THE TERM PATTON HOWEVER WAS NOT DISMISSED BY THE SCHOOL HE IS STILL TEACHING AT THE UNIVERSITY TODAY BARTLETT SAID ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES TO COME OUT OF THE INCIDENT WAS PATTON'S DESIRE TO PROTECT HIS REPUTATION HE WANTED TO BE SURE THE SCHOOL WOULD SUPPORT HIM HE FELT AS IF HIS REPUTATION HAD BEEN HARMED BY THE FACT THAT THIS BECAME PUBLIC AND THE FACT THAT HE WAS BEING ACCUSED BY SOME STUDENTS OF USING A RACIST TERM BARTLETT SAID A GROUP OF CHINESE STUDENTS WROTE A LETTER SUPPORTING PATTON AND THEY WERE BOTHERED BY THE IDEA THAT A COMMON WORD IN MANDARIN WOULD BE SEEN AS BY OTHERS AS YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY RACIST EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW IT WAS CORRECTLY PRONOUNCED BY THE PROFESSOR IT BECAME A BIG STORY IN CHINA IN SOME WAYS KIND OF A BIGGER STORY EVEN THAN IT WAS IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE CLASS WAS ONLINE IT WAS RECORDED WHEN PEOPLE SAW THE VIDEO OF THE CLASS THEY WERE NOT SURE WHY THE PROFESSOR'S CLASS BECAME A PROBLEM GUILHERME GUERREIRO IS A JOURNALISM STUDENT AT USC HE WROTE ABOUT THE STORY FOR THE ANNENBERG SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM'S WEBSITE GUERREIRO IS ORIGINALLY FROM BRAZIL AND ENGLISH IS HIS SECOND LANGUAGE HE SAID IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE STORY CAME AFTER MONTHS OF RACIAL JUSTICE PROTESTS IN THE UNITED STATES IT CAME OUT OF THE LIKE THE BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS AND ALL THAT THIS STORY HAPPENED AROUND AUGUST LIKE EARLY MID AUGUST AND THE PROTESTS AND HAD BEEN GOING ON YOU KNOW JUNE JULY ET CETERA ET CETERA SO IT CAME INTO THE WAKE OF THAT GUERREIRO SAID THE COUNTRY WAS AT VERY CRITICAL POINT A VERY DELICATE POINT BECAUSE OF THE SUMMER OF PROTESTS BARTLETT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST REPORTERS TO SPEAK WITH PATTON AFTER THE INCIDENT HE SAID THE PROFESSOR WAS WORRIED THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TEACHING STUDENTS IN THE BUSINESS SCHOOL AT USC HE APOLOGIZED TO STUDENTS WHO WERE OFFENDED PATTON ALSO SAID HE WOULD CHANGE HIS CLASS SO HE WOULD NOT USE A SOUND THAT MIGHT MAKE FUTURE STUDENTS UNCOMFORTABLE SOME COMMENTATORS THOUGHT THE REACTION BY THE STUDENTS WAS EXTREME NEWSPAPERS AROUND THE U S FROM LOS ANGELES TO NEW YORK CITY WROTE ABOUT IT THE INCIDENT EVEN BECAME PART OF A LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW RONNY CHIENG IS A COMEDIAN WHO APPEARS ON THE COMEDY CENTRAL PROGRAM THE DAILY SHOW HE SPEAKS MANDARIN IN SEPTEMBER HE SPOKE WITH THE HOST OF THE PROGRAM TREVOR NOAH PART OF THE SHOW WAS CALLED DID THAT USC PROFESSOR ACTUALLY SAY THE N WORD IN THE SEGMENT THE TWO COMEDIANS SEEMED TO CONSIDER THE OBJECTION BY THE STUDENTS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND ACTED LIKE THEY WERE UPSET WITH EACH OTHER NOAH WHO IS BLACK AND WAS BORN IN SOUTH AFRICA EVEN PROPOSED THAT THE MANDARIN LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS SHOULD NOT HAVE THE WORD AFTER AN INVESTIGATION THE UNIVERSITY FOUND THAT PATTON HAD NOT MEANT TO OFFEND ANYONE AND DID NOT BREAK ANY RULES PATTON TOLD BARTLETT THE WRITER FOR THE CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT HE DID NOT THINK THE STORY WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT THE SAME WAY IF STUDENTS HAD BEEN TAKING THE CLASS IN PERSON PATTON SAID HE WOULD HAVE HEARD IMMEDIATELY FROM CONCERNED STUDENTS DURING THE CLASS INSTEAD OF AFTER HE HAD COMPLETED THE VIDEO CLASS FOR THE DAY BARTLETT SAID HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE REACTION OF CERTAIN STUDENTS AND NOTICE THAT THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE AND PERHAPS FOLLOWED UP WITH THEM THEY WOULD HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AFTER THE CLASS PERHAPS TO COME UP AND TALK TO HIM BARTLETT ADDED THAT WHEN COMMUNICATING BY VIDEO IT'S HARDER IN A ZOOM ENVIRONMENT TO READ THE ROOM TO YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO SORT OF SENSE WHAT PEOPLE ARE HOW PEOPLE ARE REACTING WHILE SOME MAY SEE THE STUDENT GROUP'S REACTION AS EXTREME BOTH BARTLETT AND GUERREIRO SAID THERE WAS VALUE IN USC'S EFFORTS GUERREIRO SAID THE SCHOOL HAS LEARNED ABOUT BEING MORE CAREFUL WITH LANGUAGE THERE ARE SOME GRIEVANCES OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THE UNIVERSITY HE SAID ADDING THAT USC HAS MADE EFFORTS TO ANSWER STUDENT DEMANDS THEY ARE STILL CHANGING THINGS THEY'RE STILL DOING WORK THEY CREATED CERTAIN OFFICES HE NOTED BARTLETT SAID THE STORY FROM USC FITS INTO A HIGHER EDUCATION DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO DISCUSS DIFFICULT ISSUES IN THEIR CLASSES THERE'S A TENSION OFTEN BETWEEN WANTING TO LISTEN AND TAKE SERIOUSLY THE CONCERNS OF STUDENTS AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME SAY YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE THINGS THAT ARE MENTIONED IN THE CLASSROOM THAT MAY CHALLENGE WHAT YOU BELIEVE MAY SEEM TO BE OFFENSIVE MAY BRING UP IDEAS THAT ARE THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE HE ADDED THAT HE THOUGHT AT THE CENTER OF THIS CASE INVOLVING USC'S PATTON WAS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING REALLY THAT THEN GOT ELEVATED TO SOMETHING ELSE BARTLETT SAID THERE ARE CASES WHERE UNIVERSITIES NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT THEY TEACH BUT THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ONE OF THEM IN OTHER CASES THERE ARE YOU KNOW SOME REAL SUBSTANTIVE DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT WHAT'S APPROPRIATE AND WHAT IS GOING TO POTENTIALLY UPSET CERTAIN STUDENTS AND SORT OF CROSS THE LINE AND WHAT IS YOU KNOW JUST A NORMAL PART OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS AND I THINK THAT'S AN ONGOING DISCUSSION I'M DAN FRIEDELL

SCHOOLS THAT ACCEPT UNDERGRADUATES WILL NOT USE THE SAT AND ACT STANDARDIZED TESTS AND HAS NO PLANS TO REQUIRE THEM IN THE FUTURE A STANDARDIZED TEST IS AN EXAMINATION THAT IS GIVEN TO A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO COMPARE THEIR ABILITIES THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM AN UNDERGRADUATE IS A STUDENT WHO IS WORKING TOWARD THEIR FIRST COLLEGE DEGREE THE WELL KNOWN SCHOOLS IN THE SYSTEM INCLUDE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES UCLA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ''“ SANTA BARBARA THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IS RUN BY A BOARD OF REGENTS MOST ARE APPOINTED BY THE STATE'S GOVERNOR IN MID NOVEMBER THE BOARD OF REGENTS SAID IT WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND A GOOD REPLACEMENT FOR THE SAT OR ACT TESTS THE GROUP SAID THERE WOULD NOT BE A NEW TEST ANYTIME SOON STANDARDIZED TESTS HAVE BECOME A SUBJECT OF DEBATE AND LEGAL ACTION IN RECENT YEARS PART OF THE DISPUTE HAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE COVID NINETEEN PANDEMIC MANY UNIVERSITIES DECIDED IT WOULD BE UP TO STUDENTS IF THEY WANTED TO SEND TEST SCORES WITH THEIR APPLICATIONS THEY ARE KNOWN AS TEST OPTIONAL SCHOOLS MEANING THE TEST SCORES ARE NOT REQUIRED ONE OF THE MOST WELL KNOWN SCHOOLS IN THIS GROUP IS THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO IN THE LAST TWO YEARS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES REPORTED GETTING MORE APPLICATIONS FROM STUDENTS IN GENERAL THEY HAVE ESPECIALLY RECEIVED MORE APPLICATIONS FROM THE MINORITY GROUPS CRITICS SAY THE TRADITIONAL STANDARDIZED TESTS DO NOT PREDICT HOW WELL STUDENTS WILL DO IN COLLEGE IN ADDITION THEY SAY SOME BUSINESSES CREATED COSTLY TEST PREPARATION CLASSES THAT NOT EVERY STUDENT CAN PAY FOR AS A RESULT THEY SAY RICH STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE WHITE OR ASIAN ARE IN A BETTER POSITION SUPPORTERS OF THE TESTS SAY THEY HELP SOME STUDENTS WHO HAVE TROUBLE GETTING GOOD GRADES IN HIGH SCHOOL SHOW THAT THEY CAN BE GOOD COLLEGE STUDENTS THEY WORRY THAT REMOVING THE TESTS COULD KEEP THOSE STUDENTS FROM GOING TO GOOD COLLEGES TWO YEARS AGO A GROUP THAT INCLUDED THE COMPTON UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA BROUGHT LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IT CALLED FOR THE UNIVERSITIES TO REMOVE THE TEST REQUIREMENT COMPTON HAS MANY BLACK AND HISPANIC STUDENTS WHO DO NOT APPLY TO COMPETITIVE COLLEGES IN MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE UNIVERSITY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GROUPS THAT BROUGHT THE CASE IT SAID IT WOULD STOP USING THE SAT AND ACT FOR THE FOUR YEARS ENDING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT ALSO AGREED TO PAY OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN LEGAL COSTS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THEN DECIDED TO STUDY WHETHER THE TESTS PERMITTED THE SCHOOL TO BRING IN A GROUP OF DIVERSE AND ABLE STUDENTS EACH YEAR THEIR STUDY SHOWED THAT STANDARDIZED TESTS AID IN PREDICTING STUDENT PERFORMANCE INCLUDING THEIR GRADES HOWEVER THE UNIVERSITY DECIDED TO CHANGE ITS TEST POLICIES ANYWAY OVER THE LAST YEAR THE STUDY GROUP CONSIDERED USING A TEST THAT IS GIVEN TO ELEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS CALLED SMARTER BALANCED THE IDEA WAS TO REPLACE THE SAT AND ACT MARY GAUVAIN A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE WAS ONE OF THE GROUP LEADERS AT THE RECENT MEETING SHE SAID THE NEW TEST WOULD PROVIDE ONLY MODEST VALUE BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL GRADES IN PREDICTING HOW A STUDENT WOULD PERFORM IN COLLEGE IN ADDITION SHE SAID THE PROFESSORS IN THE STUDY GROUP WORRIED THAT ADDING HIGH STAKES TO THE SMARTER BALANCED TEST WOULD LEAD TO COMPANIES CREATING NEW COSTLY TEST PREPARATION CLASSES MICHAEL BROWN IS A LEADER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM CALLED THE PROVOST HE ANNOUNCED THE FINAL DECISION UC WILL CONTINUE TO PRACTICE TEST FREE ADMISSION NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE WITH THE MAJOR UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA PERMANENTLY REMOVING THE STANDARDIZED TESTS WILL OTHER UNIVERSITIES DO THE SAME JEREMY BAUER WOLF IS A REPORTER FOR HIGHEREDDIVE A WEBSITE THAT COVERS HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE U S HE SAID HE THINKS THEY WILL HIGHER EDUCATION IS VERY MUCH A CASE OF FOLLOW THE LEADER HE SAID COLLEGES DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS WANT TO ACT UNLESS THEY SEE THEIR PEERS DOING THE SAME THING THE U C SYSTEM VERY PUBLICLY DOING AWAY WITH THESE TESTS WILL REVERBERATE ESPECIALLY THROUGH CALIFORNIA BUT YOU KNOW OTHER OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT MIGHT BE LOOKED AT AS COMPETITIVE BAUER WOLF SAID UNIVERSITIES THROUGHOUT THE U S HAVE BEEN EVALUATING TEST OPTIONAL ADMISSIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC HOWEVER HE THINKS THOSE POLICIES MAY SOON BECOME PERMANENT TEST OPTIONAL HE NOTES IS DIFFERENT FROM REMOVING TESTS FROM A STUDENT'S APPLICATION A STUDY RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR LOOKED AT TEST OPTIONAL ADMISSIONS STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IT FOUND SCHOOLS THAT MADE THE CHANGE DID SEE AN INCREASE IN FIRST TIME MINORITY AND WOMEN STUDENTS ONCE MORE SCHOOLS FOLLOW CALIFORNIA AND DROP THE TEST REQUIREMENT FEWER STUDENTS WILL TAKE THE TESTS THAT WILL HURT THE COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE THE TESTS BAUER WOLF SAID THAT'S SOMETHING

voa-d034fb22-71b2-40a4-a702-01d1dd437d3e3 MONICA BENTLEY IS THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR EDISON ACADEMY IN THE AMERICAN STATE OF VIRGINIA THE ACADEMY HELPS STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT THINGS LIKE COMPUTER SECURITY CAR REPAIR HAIR AND BEAUTY CARE AND SUPERVISING A PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN BENTLEY HAS MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE HELPING STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT CAREERS BUT SHE RECENTLY HAD TROUBLE PERSUADING ONE STUDENT '' HER DAUGHTER '' TO TRY OUT A JOB TRAINING CLASS AT THE ACADEMY SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TRAVEL BENTLEY SAID OF HER DAUGHTER WHOSE MAIN SCHOOL IS ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES AWAY FROM THE CAREER TRAINING CENTER I WASN'T GOING TO MAKE HER DO IT BUT I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY SOMETIMES A SCHOOL SYSTEM HAS JUST ONE TRAINING CENTER FOR EVERY FIVE OR SIX HIGH SCHOOLS AND ASKING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO TRAVEL FROM THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL TO ANOTHER BUILDING IS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL OBSTACLES CAREER TRAINING CENTERS FACE THEY NEED TO PERSUADE STUDENTS TO TAKE MORE THAN ONE OR TWO CLASSES THEY ALSO NEED TO EXPAND PROGRAMS THAT PREPARE STUDENTS WITH BASIC TRAINING FOR HIGHER LEVEL TRAINING AFTER HIGH SCHOOL ANOTHER PROBLEM IS WHEN STUDENTS ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING CAREER TRAINING CLASSES BUT THEIR PARENTS DO NOT AGREE THEY MIGHT BELIEVE THE STUDENT SHOULD TAKE MORE CLASSES IN SUBJECTS LIKE MATH AND SCIENCE BENTLEY SAID SOMETIMES PARENTS' WISHES PREVENT TRAINING CENTERS LIKE THE EDISON ACADEMY FROM GETTING THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT THEY NEED HOWEVER ONCE PARENTS SEE THE KIND OF EDUCATION THEIR CHILD CAN RECEIVE FROM A CAREER TRAINING CENTER THEY USUALLY CHANGE THEIR MINDS CHARLES WILKINSON RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM EDISON HIGH SCHOOL AND TOOK SOME AUTO REPAIR CLASSES AT THE ACADEMY HE DESCRIBED THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE ACADEMY HE FELT AS IF THE ADULTS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL DID NOT SUPPORT STUDENTS WHO WANTED TO TAKE CAREER CLASSES THE ATTITUDE THAT STUDENTS DOING WELL SHOULDN'T WASTE THEIR TIME IN CTE CLASSES IS HEAVILY DAMAGING TO THE EXPERIENCE AND NEEDS TO SEE A CHANGE HE SAID ALISHA HYSLOP IS THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE ASSOCIATION FOR CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION HYSLOP SAID TRAINING CENTERS LIKE THE EDISON ACADEMY ARE GOOD FOR STUDENTS WHO DO NOT WANT TO ATTEND COLLEGE BUT THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THE CENTERS ALSO NEED TO TELL PEOPLE THAT MANY STUDENTS WHO TAKE CLASSES THERE MOVE ON TO ATTEND COLLEGE SHE SAID HIGH SCHOOLS AROUND THE U S NEED TO WORK HARD TO ALIGN SECONDARY PROGRAMS WITH POST SECONDARY PROGRAMS AND BUILD THOSE SEAMLESS PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS HYSLOP GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF A STUDENT WHO MIGHT EARN A STARTING CREDENTIAL FOR ENGINEERING OR COMPUTER SECURITY IN HIGH SCHOOL AFTER GRADUATION THAT STUDENT COULD THEN GO ON TO STUDY THAT SUBJECT IN COLLEGE BUILDING PATHWAYS AND STRENGTHENING PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK TOWARD THE FUTURE AND AS THE JOB MARKET CONTINUES TO REQUIRE KIND OF HIGHER AND HIGHER LEVELS OF SKILLS LAST MONTH VOA SPOKE WITH A J MUIR WHO TOOK CLASSES IN

EXPERTS DISCUSSED HOW THE COVID NINETEEN PANDEMIC TOOK AWAY SOME TRADITIONAL JOBS BUT THEY SAID IT MADE THE KIND OF JOBS THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY A HUMAN MORE IMPORTANT SUSAN LUND A GLOBAL LABOR EXPERT AT MCKINSEY SAID THERE WILL NOT BE AS MANY JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO FOR EXAMPLE ONCE HELPED BUYERS CHOOSE CLOTHES AT A STORE THAT IS BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE BUYING CLOTHING ONLINE SHE SAID HER COMPANY'S RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IN THE U S THERE WILL BE SEVENTEEN MILLION FEWER SERVICE JOBS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS MANY JOBS IN RESTAURANTS HOTELS OR STORES DO NOT REQUIRE A COLLEGE EDUCATION THE EXPERTS SAID THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT HOW THOSE SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WILL REPLACE THE INCOME FROM THOSE JOBS LUND SAID PEOPLE WHO CAN GO TO A FACTORY AND LOAD SOFTWARE ON A ROBOT WILL BE MORE IN DEMAND THAN EVER THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF IN PERSON JOBS THAT MANY STUDENTS ARE LEARNING AT CAREER TRAINING CENTERS LUND AND TRAINING CENTER EXPERT HYSLOP HAD SIMILAR THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF CAREER EDUCATION BOTH SAID TRAINING WORKS BETTER WHEN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE A GUARANTEED NEXT STEP AFTER THEY GRADUATE LUND SAID SOME HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS LAST FOR SIX YEARS INSTEAD OF THE TRADITIONAL FOUR STUDENTS WHO COMPLETE ALL SIX YEARS GRADUATE WITH A TECHNOLOGY DEGREE THERE IS A PROGRAM IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES GO STRAIGHT TO A PROGRAM AT CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AND THEY HAVE AMAZING RATES OF GRADUATION AND ARE GRADUATING STUDENTS WHO ARE THEN READY TO ACTUALLY GO GET A JOB BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME TECHNICAL SKILLS BENTLEY SAID ONE OF HER MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IS TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT HER ACADEMY'S SUCCESS SHE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING THAT MORE WHEN SCHOOL STARTS AGAIN IN AUGUST SHE THINKS ONCE STUDENTS GET A BETTER IDEA OF THE CLASS

voa-d09e90c5-06da-4b77-9691-7a72ae317be63 THE COVID NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS AFFECTING EDUCATION IN MANY COUNTRIES SOME IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED STATES ARE HAVING TO LEARN NEW SKILLS TO BEGIN TAKING CLASSES ONLINE THAT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES AND EDUCATION CUT SHORT BY EARLIER EVENTS IN THEIR LIVES NECOLE DURHAM IS A TEACHER IN AN ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM IN ATLANTA GEORGIA SHE SAYS IT IS HARD TO KEEP HER ENGLISH LEARNERS' ATTENTION THERE HAVE BEEN UPS AND DOWNS WITH THE ONLINE LEARNING I FEEL LIKE I AM MORE OF A TELEVISION PRODUCTION ARTIST WHEN I'M DOING MY CLASSES I FEEL LIKE IT HAS TO BE SO ENTERTAINING BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT THERE ARE DAYS WHEN THEY JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE GETTING ON THE COMPUTER AND LOOKING AT A COMPUTER SCREEN THAT'S MY JOB TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT SO THAT THEY WANT TO BE THERE NICHOLAS RHEA TEACHES IN A PROGRAM FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS IN NASHVILLE TENNESSEE HIS STUDENTS ARE MAINLY REFUGEES AND RECENTLY ARRIVED IMMIGRANTS HIS TEAM WORKS WITH STUDENTS WHOSE EDUCATION HAD BEEN CUT SHORT RHEA SAID THE BIGGEST DIFFICULTY IN STARTING TO LEARN ON COMPUTERS AT HOME IS TEACHING THE STUDENTS HOW TO USE THE INTERNET AND THE COMPUTER ITSELF HE TOLD VOA HE HAD TO TEACH THEM SPECIAL KEYS TO PRESS THAT IS TO HIT CONTROL ALT DELETE TO LOG INTO THE COMPUTER BEFORE JOINING THE PROGRAM SOME OF THE STUDENTS HAD NEVER USED E MAIL BEFORE MARY MIKULSKI WORKS IN A GENERAL EDUCATION OR GED ADULT PROGRAM IN SPRINGFIELD VIRGINIA HER STUDENTS COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD THEY ARE ADULT LEARNERS WHOSE FIRST LANGUAGE IS USUALLY NOT ENGLISH LIKE RHEA MIKULSKI FOUND THAT SHE HAD TO SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TEACHING HER STUDENTS HOW TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY THEY WOULD USE IN CLASS THE TEACHERS WE SPOKE WITH FOUND THEY HAD TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK FOR STUDENTS TO DO AT HOME DURHAM NOTED THAT ASKING STUDENTS TO WRITE AS IF THEY WERE IN THE CLASSROOM DID NOT SEEM TO WORK AFTER GOING ONLINE FEW STUDENTS DID THE HOMEWORK AND CORRECTING IT MADE A LOT OF WORK FOR HER SO SHE DECIDED TO USE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS LIKE ISLCOLLECTIVE AND KAHOOT THAT GIVE CORRECTIONS IMMEDIATELY SHE SAID THESE APPS ARE EASY ON THE TEACHER AND KEEP THE STUDENTS' ATTENTION AFTER RHEA STARTED OFFERING CLASSES ONLINE HE RECOGNIZED THAT SOME OF HIS STUDENTS DID NOT HAVE THE INTERNET OR A TELEPHONE LUCKILY THE LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEM HAS A ONE TO ONE COMPUTER POLICY FOR STUDENTS THIS MEANS THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM GIVES A COMPUTER TO EACH STUDENT IF THEY NEED IT ALSO IF THE FAMILY DOES NOT HAVE INTERNET CONNECTION THEY CAN RECEIVE A DEVICE THAT PROVIDES ONE RHEA ALSO HAD TO FIND WAYS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE FAMILIES OF HIS STUDENTS HE AND OTHER TEACHERS USE APPS LIKE REMIND OR TALKING POINTS TO SEND MESSAGES TO STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS THESE PROGRAMS CHANGE THE LANGUAGE FROM ENGLISH TO THE FIRST LANGUAGE OF THE STUDENT AT TIMES HE VISITED THE FAMILIES AT THEIR HOMES TO GIVE THEM INFORMATION ON HOW THE CLASSES WOULD WORK ONLINE RHEA SAID THAT HE WANTS TO GIVE HIS STUDENTS THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO WORK ONLINE HE WANTS TO SHOW THEM HOW TO USE AN EMAIL HOW TO JOIN AN ONLINE MEETING AND HOW TO BE INDEPENDENT LEARNERS ONE HELPFUL THING WITH MESSAGING ONLINE HE NOTES IS THAT STUDENTS CAN USE SMALL PICTURES SUCH AS GIFS OR EMOJIS TO SEND MESSAGES WITHOUT USING ENGLISH LIKE 'HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY ' AND THEN THEY POST UP SOME EMOJI OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT REALLY ACCESSIBLE RHEA THINKS THE PICTURES HELP STUDENTS STAY INVOLVED WITH MESSAGING ONLINE WHEN THEY DO NOT KNOW THE WORDS TO SHOW HOW THEY ARE FEELING RHEA UNDERSTANDS THE FEELING OF TIREDNESS MANY STUDENTS HAVE FROM LONG VIDEO CALLS TO HELP THEM HE MADE SOME ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE TRADITIONAL WRITING INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS A PEN SO JUST GOING OUTSIDE AND WRITING DOWN DRAWING PICTURES OF WHAT THEY SEE AND THEN THEY CAN JUST HOLD THAT UP TO THE CAMERA LATER OR TAKE A PICTURE OF IT AND UPLOAD IT TO THE DISCUSSION SO THE MAIN ACTIVITIES AREN'T ACTUALLY ONLINE THEY'RE OUTSIDE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF HIS STUDENTS COUNTS TEN THINGS HE SEES DURING A WALK TO HELP LEARN NEW WORDS ANOTHER STUDENT WORKS AT A MARKET AND LEARNS NEW WORDS BY REMEMBERING THE NAMES OF THE PRODUCTS BEING SOLD RHEA THINKS IT IS IMPORTANT TO FIND WAYS TO KEEP THE STUDENTS' ATTENTION WITHOUT USING A COMPUTER SHORTLY AFTER THE PANDEMIC WAS DECLARED MIKULSKI SPENT MOST OF HER TIME HELPING STUDENTS LEARN HOW TO OPERATE COMPUTERS FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF HER STUDENTS DID NOT KNOW WHAT A 'TAB ' OR WINDOW IN A COMPUTER APPLICATION WAS MANY OF HER STUDENTS WERE USING THEIR PHONES FOR EVERYTHING SO THEY HAD TO LEARN FROM THE BEGINNING HOW TO USE A COMPUTER MANY TEACHERS ALSO FOUND THAT THEY LEARNED FROM EACH OTHER MIKULSKI SAID IN ONE MEETING WITH TEACHERS SHE NOTICED A NEW WAY TO HAVE STUDENTS BE MORE ACTIVE IN THE CLASS SHE SAW HOW OTHER TEACHERS PERMITTED STUDENTS TO WRITE THEIR ANSWERS ON THE SAME IMAGE THE TEACHER IS SHOWING IT WAS LIKE AN 'AHA ' MOMENT 'OH YOU GIVE THEM A LINK TO YOUR GOOGLE SLIDESHOW INSTEAD OF THE PRESENT MODE ' AND THEN THEY STAY ON THEIR COPY SHE NOTES THAT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING IS IMPORTANT AS WELL AFTER MIKULSKI TAUGHT HER STUDENTS HOW TO USE THE COMPUTER SHE RECOGNIZED HER STUDENTS WERE MISSING THE CONNECTIONS THEY WOULD HAVE HAD IN CLASS SHE PERMITTED HER STUDENTS TO INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER DURING HER OFFICE HOURS MIKULSKI SAID THAT DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE STUDENTS AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IS A TOP CONCERN SHE SAID THAT AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR TEACHERS IS KNOWING YOUR STUDENTS SO THAT WHEN YOU TEACH YOU CAN REACH MORE PEOPLE DURHAM NOTED THAT ONE APPEALING THING ABOUT HER ADULT CLASSES HAS BEEN THE CHANCE TO MEET PEOPLE AND MAKE FRIENDS IN THE ONLINE CLASSES SHE BUILDS THE FEELING OF COMMUNITY BY GIVING STUDENTS TIME TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER IN BREAKOUT ROOMS ''“ A WAY TO FORM A SMALL GROUP WITHIN A LARGER ONLINE MEETING I'M JILL ROBBINS AND I'M GREGORY STACHEL

AND OTHER MATERIAL ''‹MORE EXTREMIST PROPAGANDA WAS FOUND DURING THE SPRING TERM OF TWENTY NINETEEN THAN ANY TERM IN THE PAST THE ADL SAID THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE INCIDENTS ON ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO DIFFERENT COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES ACROSS THIRTY THREE STATES AND IN WASHINGTON D C THE REPORT DOCUMENTED THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN CASES OF WHITE SUPREMACIST PROPAGANDA ON U S CAMPUSES BETWEEN SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE END OF MAY TWENTY NINETEEN THE CASES WERE TIED TO ORGANIZATIONS LINKED TO WHAT HAS BECOME KNOWN AS THE ALTERNATIVE RIGHT OR ALT RIGHT MOVEMENT THE ADL SAYS

STUDENTS ON U S COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND SO I'M SURE THEY HAVE PICKED UP SOME FOLKS YOUNG WHITE MEN AS I'VE SAID WHO MAYBE HAVE BEEN READING HATE MATERIAL ONLINE ANYWAYS WHO HAVE FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT ON CAMPUS MAYBE IT IS TOO LIBERAL FOR THEIR TASTE AND WHO MIGHT DECIDE TO CALL SOMEBODY UP LIKE THIS AND YOU KNOW THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE WITH HIGHER DEGREES IN THIS MOVEMENT SHE ALSO SAYS THAT HATE GROUPS SUPPORT SOME OF THE POLICIES OF U S PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHAT THEY LIKED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT HIS ENTIRE MESSAGE BUT THEY LIKE THE IDEA OF A MUSLIM BAN THEY LIKE THE ANTI IMMIGRANT POLICIES THAT TRUMP ADVOCATED IN THE CAMPAIGN AND NOW HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN WITH THINGS LIKE ICE RAIDS AND BUILDING THE WALL AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS HAPPENING FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE GOVERNMENT ENERGIZES THIS MOVEMENT ''‹ IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS CRITICIZED FOR FAILING TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS BY NAME IMMEDIATELY AFTER VIOLENT CLASHES IN CHARLOTTESVILLE

voa-d844b3e9-6867-4592-9e19-bbaaa04ba8832 SEVERAL RECENT STUDIES HAVE LINKED ADDITIONAL HEALTH PROBLEMS WITH WHAT IS CALLED LONG COVID LONG COVID DESCRIBES A CONDITION IN WHICH SYMPTOMS OF THE CORONAVIRUS INFECTION REMAIN FOR A LONG TIME THE FINDINGS IN THE STUDIES WERE RECENTLY RELEASED AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY REVIEWED OR SUPPORTED BY OTHER RESEARCH REUTERS NEWS AGENCY REPORTED ON THE FINDINGS ONE STUDY FOR EXAMPLE HAS FOUND A LINK BETWEEN LONG COVID AND KIDNEY PROBLEMS THE RESEARCHERS EXAMINED THE HEALTH RECORDS OF MORE THAN ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION U S VETERANS THAT INCLUDES NEARLY NINETY THOUSAND PATIENTS WHO HAD COVID NINETEEN INFECTIONS AND HAD SYMPTOMS LASTING AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THOSE PEOPLE WERE AT HIGHER RISK FOR NEW KIDNEY PROBLEMS COMPARED TO THOSE WHO HAD NOT BEEN INFECTED THIS WAS TRUE EVEN WHEN THE PEOPLE HAD NOT BEEN HOSPITALIZED SEVERE INFECTIONS RESULTED IN POORER KIDNEY HEALTH THE RESEARCHERS REPORTED THE STUDY WAS PUBLISHED RECENTLY IN THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF THE LONG COVID GROUP DEVELOPED AT LEAST A THIRTY PERCENT DROP IN AN IMPORTANT MEASURE OF KIDNEY FUNCTION KNOWN AS EGFR PEOPLE WITH LONG COVID WERE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT MORE LIKELY THAN UNINFECTED PEOPLE TO HAVE A THIRTY PERCENT DECREASE IN EGFR HIGHER RISKS WERE REPORTED IN THOSE WITH MORE SEVERE COVID NINETEEN CASES THE RESEARCHERS NOTED THAT AS PEOPLE AGE THEIR KIDNEYS OFTEN DO NOT WORK AS WELL DOCTOR ZIYAD AL ALY OF WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST LOUIS HELPED WRITE THE STUDY HE SAID DAMAGE TO THE PATIENTS' KIDNEYS WAS GREATER THAN WHAT HAPPENS WITH NORMAL AGING ANOTHER STUDY FOUND THAT LOSS OF SMELL MAY BE FOLLOWED BY CHANGES IN THE ABILITY TO SMELL AFTER A COVID INFECTION MANY PEOPLE WHO REPORT LOSING THEIR SENSE OF SMELL BECAUSE OF COVID NINETEEN DO REGAIN IT BUT A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT SOME PATIENTS LATER REPORT SMELL DISTORTIONS AND UNEXPLAINED SMELLS A GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL SCIENTISTS PUBLISHED THEIR FINDINGS IN MEDRXIV THE SERVICE PUBLISHES EARLY MEDICAL RESEARCH BEFORE IT IS FULLY REVIEWED THE RESEARCHERS EXAMINED RESPONSES FROM ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD COVID NINETEEN BETWEEN APRIL AND SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ALL HAD SUFFERED A LOSS OF SMELL AND TASTE AT THE START OF THEIR SICKNESSES EARLY ON ABOUT TEN PERCENT ALSO REPORTED SMELL DISTORTIONS AND UNEXPLAINED SMELLS AT SIX TO SEVEN MONTHS AFTER FIRST REPORTING A LOSS OF SMELL SIXTY PERCENT OF WOMEN AND FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF MEN HAD REGAINED LESS THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEIR PRE SICKNESS ABILITY TO SMELL AND RATES OF SMELL DISTORTIONS AND UNEXPLAINED SMELLS HAD INCREASED NEARLY FORTY PERCENT REPORTED SMELL DISTORTIONS THEY SAID FOR EXAMPLE SOME THINGS NOW SMELL LIKE CHEMICALS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT REPORTED UNEXPLAINED SMELLS SOMETIMES I CAN SMELL BURNING BUT NO ONE ELSE AROUND ME CAN ONE PERSON REPORTED ONGOING SMELL PROBLEMS WERE SEEN MORE OFTEN IN PATIENTS WITH MORE SYMPTOMS THE WRITERS OF THE STUDY SUGGESTED THAT PROBLEMS WITH THE SENSE OF SMELL MIGHT BE A CENTRAL MARKER OF LONG COVID A THIRD STUDY FOUND THAT ONE KIND OF COVID NINETEEN VACCINE CAN PRODUCE ANTIBODIES EVEN WHEN A PERSON HAS A WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM THE RESEARCHERS SAID MRNA COVID NINETEEN VACCINES CAUSE PROTECTIVE IMMUNE REACTIONS IN MOST CANCER PATIENTS WITH SOLID CANCER GROWTHS THEY ALSO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES IN PEOPLE TAKING MEDICINES THAT CAUSE THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS TO WEAKEN THAT IS WHAT TWO RECENT STUDIES IN ISRAEL SUGGEST THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT SIX MONTHS AFTER THE SECOND

CHANGED GENETIC MATERIAL AT THE SAME TIME EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE PEOPLE WITHOUT CANCER DEVELOPED ANTIBODIES ANTIBODY LEVELS WERE SIMILAR IN THE TWO GROUPS THE RESEARCHERS REPORTED RECENTLY IN THE PUBLICATION CANCER DISCOVERY SEPARATELY U S RESEARCHERS STUDIED ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE ADULTS TAKING MEDICINES THAT CAUSE A WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM AND FIFTY THREE HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS THE STUDY FOUND THAT THREE WEEKS AFTER THE SECOND SHOT OF A VACCINE FROM PFIZER BIONTECH OR MODERNA NEARLY NINETY PERCENT OF THE IMMUNE WEAKENED PEOPLE HAD DEVELOPED ANTIBODIES BUT MANY HAD LOWER REACTIONS COMPARED TO THE HEALTHY GROUP THE STUDY WAS PUBLISHED IN ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE BOTH STUDIES INVOLVED A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND FINALLY A SEPARATE STUDY ON THE ANTIBODY TREATMENT FROM REGENERON FOUND A LOWER RATE OF HOSPITALIZATION IN PATIENTS PEOPLE WITH COVID NINETEEN TREATED WITH A MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY MIXTURE HAD LOWER HOSPITALIZATION RATES THAN THOSE WITHOUT THE TREATMENT A STUDY RECENTLY SAID THE PATIENTS HAD MILD TO MODERATE COVID NINETEEN CASES THE RESEARCHERS REPORTED THE FINDINGS IN ECLINICALMEDICINE THE STUDY WAS NOT RANDOMIZED AND CANNOT PROVE THE TREATMENT CAUSED THE BETTER RESULTS BUT IT SUGGESTS HIGH RISK PATIENTS WITH MILD OR MODERATE COVID NINETEEN MAY BE ABLE TO RECOVER WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL I'M CATY WEAVER AND I'M ALICE

SHE CALLED THE NEW YORK CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT THAT CALL SOON LED TO NATIONAL ACTION IN WHAT WOULD BECOME THE H ONE N ONE INFLUENZA PANDEMIC INCLUDING THE CLOSURE OF SOME SCHOOLS LAURIE COMBE IS PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL NURSES OR NASN SHE RECENTLY TOLD VOA THAT WHILE SCHOOL NURSES CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE DURING ANY PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THEY ARE ALWAYS SENTINELS FOR HEALTH IN THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY COMBE EXPLAINED THAT DURING A HEALTH CRISIS SCHOOL NURSES CAN TAKE ON AN AMPLIFIED ROLE DURING THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS TEACHING CHILDREN AND OTHERS HOW TO WEAR FACE COVERINGS AND WASH THEIR HANDS IS ONLY A SMALL PIECE OF THEIR WORK AS THE VIRUS PICKED UP SPEED AND SCHOOLS CLOSED COMBE SAYS NURSES CONTINUED DO MUCH OF THEIR USUAL WORK WHILE TAKING ON NEW RESPONSIBILITIES SOME OF WHICH INVOLVED PLANNING SCHOOL NURSES ARE HIGHLY ENGAGED IN THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND HAVE EXPERTISE IN EMERGENCY PLANNING FOR PANDEMICS MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE DECIDING WHETHER AND HOW TO REOPEN FOR THE FALL TERM THE PLANNING COMES AS SOME PARTS OF THE U S EXPERIENCE SHARP INCREASES IN CORONAVIRUS INFECTION RATES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN IN THE FALL HE RECENTLY CRITICIZED SAFETY GUIDELINES SET BY THE U S CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN TRUMP SAID HE FOUND THE GUIDELINES IMPRACTICAL AND TOO COSTLY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS THREATENED TO WITHHOLD FEDERAL MONEY IF DISTRICTS DO NOT FULLY REOPEN STILL EVEN WHEN SCHOOLS REMAIN PHYSICALLY CLOSED THE NEED FOR NURSES' USUAL EXPERTISE DOES NOT DISAPPEAR FOR INSTANCE DURING THE SPRING TERM NURSES CONTINUED MANY OF THEIR DAILY DUTIES SUCH AS KEEPING IN CONTACT WITH PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH HEALTH CONDITIONS OR PARENTS WHO NEEDED MEDICAL ADVICE AND RESOURCES SOME NURSES EVEN TOOK MEDICINES AND EQUIPMENT TO HOMES OF STUDENTS WITH HEALTH CONDITIONS WHEN SCHOOLS SHUT THEIR DOORS SOME STUDENTS RECEIVED NO HOME INSTRUCTION SO SOME NURSES REACHED OUT TO FAMILIES AND STUDENTS TO FIND OUT IF THEIR NEEDS WERE BEING MET ASIDE FROM PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS NURSES FOUND THAT MANY STUDENTS LACKED ACCESS TO THE INTERNET THE NEED FOR MEALS CONTINUED TOO SO NURSES HELPED OVERSEE THE SAFE PROCESSES FOR DELIVERING FOOD TO STUDENTS COMBE SAID AROUND THIRTY MILLION AMERICAN CHILDREN DEPEND ON LOW COST OR FREE SCHOOL MEALS EACH DAY FOR NUTRITION THE U S DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORTS AS SCHOOLS REMAINED CLOSED NURSES STAYED CONNECTED THROUGH LOCAL AND NATIONAL GROUPS TO STAY INFORMED ABOUT THE VIRUS THEY ALSO TURNED TO STATE AND FEDERAL HEALTH AGENCIES FOR EXPERT GUIDANCE JANIS HOGAN IS A NURSE AT CAMDEN HILLS REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL IN ROCKPORT MAINE WHEN SCHOOLS IN HER STATE CLOSED IN THE SPRING SHE CONTINUED TO PERFORM SOME DAY TO DAY RESPONSIBILITIES BUT SHE ALSO BEGAN TAKING PART IN VIDEO MEETINGS WITH SCHOOL NURSES FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY AND HOGAN JOINED AN INTERNATIONAL ONLINE GROUP OF MOSTLY SCHOOL NURSES TO LEARN WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN EUROPE'S REOPENED SCHOOLS SO IN SOME WAYS IT WAS AN AMAZING TIME OF CONNECTION FOR SCHOOL NURSES BECAUSE WE WERE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT BUT OUR BOATS ARE ALL A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT HOGAN IS ALSO ON A TEAM CONSIDERING THE STATE'S PLANS TO REOPEN SCHOOLS MAINE WHICH HAS HAD COMPARABLY LOW CORONAVIRUS INFECTION RATES RECENTLY RELEASED ITS FIRST REOPENING PROPOSAL SCHOOL NURSES ARE NAMED THROUGHOUT THE PLAN AS CENTRAL TO THE TEAM EFFORT WHICH INCLUDES ADMINISTRATORS TEACHERS TRANSPORTATION WORKERS FOOD SERVICE AND OTHERS NURSES NATIONALLY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE COOPERATIVE EFFORTS BUT NOT ALL SCHOOLS HAVE THEIR OWN SCHOOL NURSE U S SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEGAN CUTTING NURSE STAFF LEADING UP TO THE GREAT RECESSION OF THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS MOST DISTRICTS DID NOT BRING THE NURSES BACK INSTEAD MANY THAT WERE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR JOBS NOW WORK PART TIME AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT SCHOOLS A TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDY BY NASN SHOWED THAT JUST THIRTY NINE PERCENT OF U S SCHOOLS EMPLOY A FULL TIME NURSE AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD NO NURSE AT ALL ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT HAVE A PART TIME NURSE THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS OR AAP AN ORGANIZATION OF CHILDREN'S DOCTORS URGES THAT ALL SCHOOLS HAVE AT LEAST ONE FULL TIME NURSE A FEW YEARS AGO THE AAP SAID IT WOULD BE BEST TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE NURSE FOR EVERY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS BUT EVEN NOW AS THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS CONTINUES MANY U S SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE JUST ONE NURSE FOR WELL OVER ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS HOGAN SAID THE SHORTAGE IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING BECAUSE MANY CHILDREN RECEIVE THEIR MAIN OR ONLY MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM SCHOOL NURSES NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE THE EARLIER U S PANDEMICS A REPORT BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH OR NIH ON THE NINETEEN EIGHTEEN INFLUENZA PANDEMIC STATED THAT OFFICIALS IN SOME CITIES SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY AND NEW HAVEN CONNECTICUT CHOSE TO KEEP PUBLIC SCHOOLS OPEN OFFICIALS REASONED THAT MANY CHILDREN WOULD HAVE LITTLE OR NO MEDICAL SUPERVISION IF SCHOOLS CLOSED THEY ALSO ARGUED THAT SCHOOLS COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVELY DISINFECTED THAN HOMES IN THOSE CITIES SCHOOL NURSES AND DOCTORS PERFORMED DAILY MEDICAL INSPECTIONS AT SCHOOLS THE NURSES ALSO EDUCATED THEIR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES ON VIRUS PREVENTION AND SOME MADE HOME VISITS TO INSPECT THE HEALTH OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHILE MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY THE NEED FOR HEALTH EXPERTS AT SCHOOLS DURING A PANDEMIC HAS NOT WITH LARGE DROPS IN TAX REVENUES CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC SCHOOLS ACROSS THE U S HAVE EXPERIENCED HUGE BUDGET CUTS COMBE FINDS THIS CONCERNING SHE SAID THAT SHE HAS ALREADY HEARD REPORTS OF SOME NURSING CUTS ALTHOUGH MASSIVE REDUCTIONS HAVE NOT YET HAPPENED COMBE ADDED THAT SOME SCHOOLS ARE LOOKING TO BRING IN MORE NURSES TO HELP WITH THE EXPECTED WORK LOAD TO COME IF SCHOOLS REOPEN THERE ARE ALSO WORRIES ABOUT GETTING NECESSARY SUPPLIES IN THE HOUSTON TEXAS AREA FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE EDUCATION AGENCY IS PROVIDING SCHOOLS PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT OR PPE BUT THE EQUIPMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE HIGH QUALITY N NINETY FIVE FACE MASKS SCHOOL HEALTH ROOMS HISTORICALLY HAVE VERY SMALL BUDGETS '' MAYBE TEN TWENTY THIRTY CENTS PER STUDENT FOR A WHOLE SCHOOL YEAR A CONGRESSIONAL BILL CALLED THE NURSE ACT LAUNCHED IN MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN INTENDED TO INCREASE SCHOOL NURSES IN

YEARS AGO I WAS AT A CAFE ORDERING FOOD WHEN I SAID THE WORD EGG IN FRENCH THE SERVER DID NOT UNDERSTAND ME AFTER A FEW MORE TRIES HE STILL HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY I WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT EXPERIENCE REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING HAVING TOO FEW CHANCES TO SPEAK A LANGUAGE CAN LEAVE US UNCLEAR ABOUT OUR PRONUNCIATION ABILITY MANY OF YOU OUT THERE CAN PROBABLY RELATE YOU MAY HAVE HAD TROUBLE FINDING ENGLISH PRACTICE PARTNERS IN YOUR OWN CITY OR COUNTRY ONE ANSWER IS TO USE AN APP FOR PRONUNCIATION PRACTICE WHILE MOST SUCH APPS ARE IMPERFECT THEY MAY SUPPORT YOUR OVERALL EFFORTS TO BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD IN ENGLISH ON TODAY'S EDUCATION TIPS WE WILL TALK ABOUT FOUR AMERICAN ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION APPS THE FIRST ONE IS CALLED SAY IT PRONUNCIATION THIS APP'S GOAL IS TO HELP LEARNERS IMPROVE THE CLARITY OF THEIR PRONUNCIATION IT WAS DEVELOPED BY OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS ''“ THE SAME PUBLISHERS THAT BROUGHT US THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DICTIONARY USERS OF SAY IT PRONUNCIATION CAN PRACTICE MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND WORDS WITH THE APP YOU CAN TAKE A PRONUNCIATION TEST OF WORDS PRE CHOSEN BY THE APP FROM EASY TO DIFFICULT TOUCH LETTERS FROM THE IPA TO HEAR WHAT EACH SOUNDS LIKE RECORD YOURSELF SAYING A WORD THE APP THEN CREATES A WAVEFORM FROM YOUR VOICE AND YOU CAN COMPARE IT TO THAT OF THE MODEL SPEAKER A MARKER SHOWS WHICH PART OF EACH WORD TO STRESS PLAY YOUR RECORDING AT A SLOWER SPEED TO HEAR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUR PRONUNCIATION AND THE MODEL'''S SAVE A LIST OF WORDS YOU WOULD LIKE TO PRACTICE OFTEN AND SHARE YOUR PRONUNCIATION RECORDING WITH A FRIEND OR TEACHER SAY IT PRONUNCIATION OFFERS A FREE VERSION BUT ITS USABILITY IS LIMITED YOU WOULD NEED TO BUY THE PAID VERSION TO GET FULL USE OF THE APP WHICH COSTS SIX DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS NEXT UP IS THE APP ELSA SPEAK ESLA SPEAK USES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OR AI TO ACT AS YOUR OWN AMERICAN ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION TEACHER ONE OF THE STRONG POINTS OF THIS APP IS THAT IT OFFERS A SPEAKING TEST WITH DETAILED RESULTS AND A SCORE ANOTHER IS THAT ITS AI SOFTWARE LETS YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMPUTER AND GET FEEDBACK WITH THE APP YOU CAN TAKE A SPEAKING TEST TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR BIGGEST PRONUNCIATION PROBLEMS AFTER THE TEST ELSA SPEAK PUTS TOGETHER YOUR PERSONALIZED LESSON PLANS LISTEN TO ELSA SPEAK REPEAT ITS WORDS OR PHRASES AND GET IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK ON HOW TO MOVE YOUR LIPS AND TONGUE FOR BETTER SOUND CLARITY DO FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF LESSONS PRONUNCIATION LISTENING SYLLABLE STRESS AND CONVERSATION AND CHOOSE A TIME THAT YOU WANT TO PRACTICE AND GET REMINDERS FROM THE APP EACH DAY ELSA SPEAK HAS A FREE SEVEN DAY TRIAL VERSION THAT LETS YOU TAKE THE SPEAKING TEST AND USE ITS TWELVE HUNDRED LESSONS AFTER THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO PAY FOR THE FULL VERSION PRICES RANGE FROM NINETY NINE CENTS TO NINETY NINE DOLLARS FOR IN APP PURCHASES NEXT UP IS ACCENT TRAINING WHICH WAS DESIGNED FOR IPAD AND CAN OPERATE ON AN IPHONE IT ALSO HAS AN ANDROID VERSION WHICH GOES BY THE NAME AMERICAN ENGLISH ACCENT GUIDE BOTH CENTER ON A FEW IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF PRONUNCIATION INCLUDING REDUCED SPEECH INTONATION AND CONNECTED SPEECH WITH THE APP YOU CAN PRACTICE LISTENING TO AND USING REDUCED SPEECH READ ALONG AS YOU LISTEN TO SHORT PASSAGES AND SEE IN RED WHICH PHRASES ARE REDUCED TRY RECORDING YOURSELF READING THE PASSAGES AND COMPARE YOUR RECORDINGS TO THAT OF THE MODEL LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF PRONUNCIATION SUCH AS VOICED AND UNVOICED CONSONANTS AND THE SCHWA SOUND AND CONNECT TO OTHER USEFUL APPS SUCH AS 'VOA ENGLISH LEARNING ' WHICH IS NOT OUR APP BUT DOES USE OUR CONTENT THE IPHONE VERSION OFFERS SIXTEEN PRACTICES THE ANDROID VERSION OFFERS A VIRTUAL CONVERSATION ROOM HOWEVER SOME USERS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE ROOM'S TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THE APP IS FREE BUT UNWANTED ADS SHOW UP OFTEN YOU CAN CHOOSE WHETHER TO PAY TWO DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS TO REMOVE THEM ''‹ AND FINALLY WE HAVE ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION TUTOR ON ANDROID THE APP IS CALLED AMERICAN ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION TUTOR DEVELOPED BY LANGUAGE ARTS PRESS THE APP IS USEFUL IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC SOUNDS IN ENGLISH THAT GIVE YOU CONTINUOUS TROUBLE WITH THE APP YOU CAN FOCUS ON ONE ELEMENT OF PRONUNCIATION IN EACH UNIT FOR INSTANCE UNIT ONE IS ABOUT THE FRONT VOWELS SEE DRAWINGS AND HEAR RECORDED EXPLANATIONS OF THE MOUTH SHAPE AND TONGUE POSITIONS THAT PRODUCE EACH SOUND SEE PICTURES OF SIMILAR SOUNDS SIDE BY SIDE AND TOUCH THE PICTURES TO COMPARE HOW TO PRODUCE EACH SOUND RECORD YOURSELF SAYING WORDS AND COMPARE YOURSELF TO THE MODEL AND TAKE A LISTENING QUIZ ON THE SOUNDS OF EACH UNIT THE APP IS FREE FOR THE FIRST UNIT ONLY AFTER THAT YOU WOULD PAY FIVE DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS TO ACTIVATE THE FULL VERSION AGAIN NONE OF THESE APPS CAN REPLACE REAL LIFE SPEAKING PRACTICE BUT IF YOU ARE IN SERIOUS NEED OF PRONUNCIATION SUPPORT THEY MAY HELP A WORD OF ADVICE AIM FOR BETTER COMMUNICATION RATHER THAN PERFECTION KEEP IN MIND THAT HAVING AN ACCENT IS NORMAL AND ONLY AN ISSUE IF IT PREVENTS LISTENERS FROM UNDERSTANDING YOU SO MAKE YOUR GOAL TO BE UNDERSTOOD NOT TO SOUND EXACTLY LIKE AN AMERICAN NOTE THAT MANY AMERICANS IN FACT ADMIRE THE ACCENTS OF ENGLISH LEARNERS I'M ALICE BRYANT

ONE HUNDRED THIRTY COUNTRIES MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT REPORTED CHANGES TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR VULNERABLE PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN AND TEENS IN THE U S SCHOOL CLOSURES HAVE LED TO A LOSS OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR MANY STUDENTS OKOYA NOTES THAT STUDENTS ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING THINGS LIKE INTERNET CONNECTION ISSUES OTHERS MAY SHARE ONE COMPUTER WITH THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS OR THEY MAY LIVE IN A SMALL SPACE WITH THEIR FAMILY AND CANNOT SPEAK PRIVATELY ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS SO HOW HAVE SCHOOLS REACTED TO THE CHANGES AND WHAT CAN THEY DO MOVING FORWARD FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS TELEHEALTH HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE SAYS OKOYA TELEHEALTH IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH SOME HEALTHCARE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THE INTERNET BUT FOR THE MAIN SCHOOL POPULATION MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS AGREE ABOUT THE NEED FOR SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE STRUCTURE AND ROUTINES FOR STUDENTS THEY ALSO SAY BUILDING A SENSE OF CONNECTION AND BELONGING BETWEEN STUDENTS AND WITH SUPPORTIVE ADULTS IS CRITICAL THAT INCLUDES TEACHERS OR OTHER ADULTS AT SCHOOL HAVING DAILY CHECK INS WITH STUDENTS OKOYA SAYS THIS IS IMPORTANT ''“ EVEN IF THE CHILD'S CAMERA IS OFF OR IF THE STUDENT DOES NOT SHARE THEIR SPECIFIC PROBLEMS OPENING UP THE LINE OF COMMUNICATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT ''“ EVEN IF IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIGGER THING THAT YOUNG PERSON KNOWING THAT THERE'S AN ADULT WHO CARES ABOUT THEM WHO IS REACHING OUT TO THEM WHO'S MAKING THE TIME TO TALK TO THEM IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT HOW CHECK INS AND OTHER EMOTIONAL SUPPORTS ARE CARRIED OUT DIFFER FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL OKOYA SAYS THE JED FOUNDATION WORKS WITH SOME SCHOOLS THAT HAVE PUT IN PLACE BREAKOUT ROOMS THIS INVOLVES BREAKING CLASSES INTO SMALLER ONLINE ROOMS SO THAT STUDENTS CAN SHARE MORE OPENLY SACHDEV SAYS SOME SCHOOLS SHE WORKS WITH IN WASHINGTON D C HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB WITH CHECK INS THEY HAVE CHOSEN A TEACHER OR OTHER SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TO WORK WITH STUDENTS AND FAMILIES SO EACH STUDENT HAS A POINT PERSON THEY CHECK IN WITH EVERY DAY AND THEY DO NOT HAVE TO SEARCH FOR SOMEONE THEY CAN TALK TO THE SYSTEM ALSO HELPS PARENTS OR GUARDIANS THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT TEACHERS OTHER TEACHERS USE A MOOD METER A KIND OF MAP THAT DIVIDES FEELINGS INTO COLORS DURING ADVISORY PERIODS EACH DAY AND SINCE STUDENTS HAVE SEVERAL CLASS PERIODS PER DAY THEIR OTHER TEACHERS CAN DO THE SAME IF THEY ARE ABLE TO OKOYA SAYS OVERALL THE PANDEMIC HAS PROVEN THAT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS LEARNING OTHER SUBJECTS SAYS SACHDEV EXPERTS LIKE OKOYA AND SACHDEV WANT THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THAT MENTAL HEALTHCARE IS MORE THAN JUST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A STUDENT AND A COUNSELOR EVERY ADULT WHO HAS CONTACT WITH A YOUNG PERSON MAY BE ABLE TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH OKOYA SAYS EVEN A BUS DRIVER FOR EXAMPLE CAN URGE A STUDENT TO ASK FOR HELP SACHDEV EXPLAINS THAT SCHOOLS MUST NOT BE THE ONLY ONES ENSURING GOOD MENTAL HEALTH FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES SUPPORT SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES ARE ALSO NEEDED FROM OTHER FIELDS INCLUDING HEALTHCARE THE WORKFORCE CHILD WELFARE JUSTICE AND OTHERS SHE SAYS I'M ALICE BRYANT

IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH HIS STUDENTS IN ENGLISH SOMETIMES HE HAS TROUBLE TODAY THAT HE SAID IS ONE REASON WHY HIS OLD STUDENT ARISTIDE GUMYUSENGE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT PROFESSOR AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY OR MIT GUMYUSENGE WHO GREW UP IN RWANDA WILL START HIS CAREER AT MIT IN JANUARY HE IS ONLY THIRTY YEARS OLD GUMYUSENGE IS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING HE RECENTLY FINISHED ADVANCED RESEARCH AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA IF GUMYUSENGE DOES A GOOD JOB OVER THE FIRST FIVE YEARS HE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO BE A PERMANENT PROFESSOR AT MIT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH VOA GUMYUSENGE SAID HE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO OPENING THE ORGANIC MATERIALS FOR SMART ELECTRONICS LAB AT MIT HE IS CURRENTLY LOOKING AT STUDENTS FOR HIS RESEARCH TEAM GROWING UP IN RWANDA GUMYUSENGE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION HIS FATHER WAS A TEACHER AFTER ALL BUT HE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT TEACHING EVEN AFTER HIGH SCHOOL I STILL THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL GUMYUSENGE TOLD VOA HE ARRIVED IN THE U S IN THE AUTUMN OF TWENTY ELEVEN AFTER RECEIVING A SCHOLARSHIP TO WOFFORD COLLEGE IN SOUTH CAROLINA HE WAS PART OF THE RWANDA PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS PROGRAM GUMYUSENGE SAID IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE STARTED HIS ADVANCED DEGREE WORK AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN INDIANA THAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT A CAREER AS A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR HE IS PLANNING TO CONTINUE THE WORK HE DID AT PURDUE AND STANFORD ON ENGINEERING ELECTRONIC DEVICES HE SAID SOME OF THE THINGS PEOPLE SEE IN MOVIES SET IN THE FUTURE WHERE PEOPLE ARE WEARING SMART SUITS AND SMART DEVICES ARE GETTING CLOSE TO BECOMING REAL HE GAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A CONTACT LENS THAT CAN MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR IN THE BODY WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE ELECTRONICS THAT CAN BE MORE COMPATIBLE WITH THE BODY BOTH MECHANICALLY AND CHEMICALLY GUMYUSENGE IS WORKING TO CREATE MATERIALS THAT CAN MOVE ELECTRICITY IN THE SAME WAY THAT METALS IN COMPUTERS CHIPS DO NOW HE SAID THE NEXT THING IS FOR ENGINEERS AND CHEMISTS TO WORK TOGETHER SO THEY CAN MAKE PRODUCTS THAT WORK BETTER WITH THE BODY BUT RESEARCH IS ONLY PART OF HIS JOB HE NEEDS TO WORK WITH STUDENTS AND THAT IS WHERE MEI SAID GUMYUSENGE IS STRONGEST ARISTIDE'S TRAINING IN ENGLISH PROBABLY HELPS HIM MEI SAID ADDING HE HANDLES THE LANGUAGE MUCH BETTER THAN I DO MEI POINTED OUT THAT GUMYUSENGE HAD TO WORK AS A TEACHING ASSISTANT DURING HIS TIME AT PURDUE BOTH GIVING LESSONS AND HELPING STUDENTS IN THE LABORATORY IT CAN CAUSE A LOT OF WORRY FOR TEACHERS WHO DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH WELL UNDERGRAD STUDENTS DEMAND MUCH MORE ACTUALLY THAN GRAD STUDENTS MEI SAID NOTING THAT HIS OWN DIFFICULTY WITH ENGLISH IS NOT AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE IN HIS WORK WITH PH D STUDENTS GUMYUSENGE SPEAKS ENGLISH VERY WELL HOW DID HE LEARN GROWING UP IN RWANDA AFTER HIS COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR ENDED ONE OF HIS FAVORITE THINGS TO DO WAS TO LISTEN TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE BROADCASTS ON THE FAMILY'S RADIO WHENEVER HE HAD THE CHANCE HE LISTENED TO THE VOA LEARNING ENGLISH PROGRAMMING GUMYUSENGE SAID HE ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES AS A TEENAGER ABLE TO SPEAK WELL AND UNDERSTAND AMERICAN ENGLISH ACCENTS THANKS TO THE PROGRAMS HE SAID THE SLOWER SPEED OF THE LEARNING ENGLISH BROADCASTS HELPED HIM LEARN QUICKLY COMPARED TO NEWS AND MUSIC PROGRAMS IN ENGLISH THE ACTUAL LEARNING PROGRAM THE SPEED WAS ADJUSTED SO THAT PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF CAN PICK IT UP YOU DON'T GET THAT ONCE YOU HIT THE GROUND HERE REALLY THANKFUL FOR THE PROGRAM AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU ALL ARE DOING IN RWANDA HE WAS ABLE TO LEARN TO READ ENGLISH BUT IT WAS HARD TO FIND PEOPLE WHO COULD SPEAK WITHOUT AN ACCENT THE ANNOUNCERS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING IN RWANDA HAD AN ACCENT SO VOA HE SAID HELPED HIM LEARN AMERICAN ACCENTS SPEAKING ENGLISH HE SAID CAN HELP YOU GET A JOB IN ADDITION GUMYUSENGE SAID A LOT OF SCIENCE VIDEOS ARE IN ENGLISH SO STUDENTS CAN LEARN QUITE A BIT ON THEIR OWN BY FOLLOWING THEM AT WOFFORD HE FOUND A WAY TO TALK WITH AMERICAN STUDENTS ONE TOPIC HE LEARNED SO HE COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION THE STAR WARS MOVIES HE UNDERSTOOD IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO LEARN HOW TO SPEAK CONFIDENTLY WITH AMERICANS AT FIRST HE JUST LISTENED AND TRIED TO SPEAK THE SAME WAY AS HIS SCHOOLMATES I GUESS I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE I GOT HERE WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN SO I STILL HAD SOME FLEXIBILITY I GUESS IN THE BRAIN TO ALLOW MYSELF TO LEARN WHILE GUMYUSENGE DOES NOT HAVE A STRONG ACCENT NOW YOU SHOULD HAVE MET ME IN TWENTY ELEVEN HE SAID WHAT DOES HE SAY TO INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES TODAY DO NOT HOLD ON TOO TIGHTLY TO YOUR OLD LIFE AT HOME EXPERIENCE LIFE IN AMERICA WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE I KNOW PEOPLE WHO GET HERE AND CHANGE NOTHING ABOUT THEIR DAILY ROUTINE HE SAID THEY LIVE AS IF THEY'RE STILL LIVING IN

voa-e906f655-d8c9-421e-8cd2-b4619e5a5d163 HARRY QIU BEGAN LEARNING ENGLISH AS A YOUNG BOY IN SHANGHAI CHINA OVER THE YEARS HE BECAME FLUENT AND LATER CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FOR COLLEGE QIU NOW ATTENDS DICKINSON COLLEGE IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA WHERE HE STUDIES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THERE HE IS LEARNING TWO MORE LANGUAGES ''“ RUSSIAN AND JAPANESE AND THROUGH THE SCHOOL HE GETS TO TALK ONE ON ONE WITH NATIVE SPEAKERS ON SKYPE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN HE MEETS WITH HIS JAPANESE PARTNER QIU HELPS HIS PARTNER PRACTICE ENGLISH HIS PARTNER HELPS HIM PRACTICE JAPANESE WE CALL THIS A LANGUAGE EXCHANGE SUCH EXCHANGES CAN BE ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR CONVERSATION SKILLS QIU SAYS THEY HAVE GIVEN HIM THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REAL LIFE CONVERSATION AND CLASSROOM LEARNING COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE NOT THE ONLY PLACES OFFERING LANGUAGE EXCHANGES TODAY THERE ARE MANY WEBSITES AND APPS DESIGNED TO CONNECT LANGUAGE LEARNERS AROUND THE WORLD POPULAR SITES LIKE CONVERSATION EXCHANGE LINGO GLOBE EASY LANGUAGE EXCHANGE AND THE MIXXER OFFER AN ALMOST ENDLESS NUMBER OF PARTNERS TO CHOOSE FROM BUT DOING AN EXCHANGE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT CAN SOMETIMES LEAD TO WASTED TIME SO TODAY WE HAVE FIVE TIPS FOR HOW TO HAVE A GREAT LANGUAGE EXCHANGE EXPERTS SAY THE FIRST STEP IS ASK YOURSELF SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TODD BRYANT IS A LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY SPECIALIST WHO RUNS THE MIXXER A WEBSITE WITH MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ACTIVE USERS THE FREE SERVICE BEGAN AT DICKINSON COLLEGE BUT IT IS MEANT FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING FOR PRACTICE PARTNERS BRYANT SAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ASK YOURSELF IS WHY YOU WANT TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A SERIOUS REASON FOR LEARNING A LANGUAGE ARE USUALLY MORE DEPENDABLE EXCHANGE PARTNERS THESE REASONS CAN INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE MOVING TO ANOTHER COUNTRY OR USING THE LANGUAGE FOR WORK LESS SERIOUS REASONS MIGHT BE WANTING TO MEET NEW PEOPLE OR USE THE LANGUAGE FOR AN OVERSEAS VACATION ANOTHER QUESTION TO ASK YOURSELF BRYANT SAYS IS HOW MUCH FREE TIME YOU REALLY HAVE AND THEN ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND ON THIS SO YOU CAN THEN FIND A GOOD MATCH 'ARE YOU WILLING TO SPEND AN HOUR OR TWO MORE PER WEEK TO DO THIS ' IN ADDITION CONSIDER YOUR PREFERENCES ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SPEAKING PRACTICE OR DO YOU PREFER WRITTEN MESSAGES IF YOU ARE SEEKING SPEAKING PRACTICE WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE VIDEO MEETINGS OR MEET IN PERSON KNOWING YOUR PREFERRED METHOD WILL HELP YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT WEBSITE OR APP SOME WEBSITES FOR EXAMPLE LIST PEOPLE'S CITIES SO YOU CAN EASILY MAKE PLANS TO MEET PARTNERS IN PERSON OTHERS DO NOT NOW YOU ARE READY FOR TIP TWO FINDING THE RIGHT PARTNER AS I SAID EARLIER MANY OF THESE WEBSITES CAN HAVE HUNDREDS OF PARTNERS TO CHOOSE FROM IN THE LANGUAGE YOU WANT TO LEARN SO HOW CAN YOU LIMIT YOUR SEARCH BRYANT SAYS WHEN READING PROFILES LOOK FOR SOME IMPORTANT SIGNS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE SITE AND HAVE BEEN ACTIVE AND HAVE A REASON TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE GOOD PARTNERS THAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE SITE FOR A WEEK AND DON'T REALLY HAVE THEIR PROFILE FILLED OUT AND HAVEN'T BEEN ACTIVE AND ARE LEARNING SIX LANGUAGES ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT IT IS BETTER TO FIND AT LEAST TWO EXCHANGE PARTNERS PEOPLE LEAD BUSY LIVES AND ONE PERSON MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE EVERY WEEK ONCE YOU DO FIND A PERSON WHO SEEMS LIKE A GOOD FIT BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE IN THE FIRST EMAIL THAT'S TIP NUMBER THREE EXPLAIN TO THE PERSON THINGS SUCH AS HOW LONG YOU'D LIKE MEETINGS TO BE AND HOW OFTEN YOU'D LIKE TO MEET AND FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PLAN TO MEET IN PERSON SAY IF YOU ARE FINE WITH NOISY PLACES OR ONLY QUIETER PLACES BRYANT SAYS EXPRESSING EXPECTATIONS IN ADVANCE WILL GIVE THE PARTNERSHIP A HIGHER CHANCE OF GOING WELL BUT HE NOTES AVOID BEING TOO RIGID FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE HOPING FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHTS EVERY WEEK YOU'LL HAVE BETTER LUCK IF YOU STATE OTHER TIMES THAT ALSO COULD WORK FOR YOU GREG SCOTT IS A JAPANESE TO ENGLISH TRANSLATOR BASED IN AUSTRALIA HE WROTE FOR LINGUALIFT DOT COM ABOUT HIS EARLY DAYS OF LEARNING ENGLISH IN THE STORY HE NOTED THAT IT WAS EASIER FOR HIM TO HAVE UNPLANNED SKYPE MEETINGS WITH HIS EXCHANGE PARTNER BECAUSE OF HIS BUSY WORK SCHEDULE BUT THIS PLAN WAS SOMETHING BOTH PARTNERS AGREED ON NOW LET'S SAY YOU HAVE SECURED A PARTNER AND YOUR FIRST MEETING IS IN A FEW DAYS YOU ARE READY FOR TIP FOUR PREPARE AHEAD OF TIME BEFORE EACH MEETING PREPARE SOME QUESTIONS ON A TOPIC OF YOUR CHOICE THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO LOOK UP RELATED WORDS AS WELL AS THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN ANSWERS PREPARING TOPICS AHEAD OF TIME WILL ALSO HELP YOU AVOID HAVING NOTHING TO SAY AT YOUR MEETINGS NOTES BRYANT OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF TEN MINUTES IN AND YOU'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE 'WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING ' AND 'IF YOU LIKE TO TRAVEL' KIND OF QUESTIONS AND YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY OR YOU'LL FIND THAT YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THINGS AT EVERY MEETING WHICH YOU WANT TO AVOID NOW WE MOVE TO TIP FIVE ''“ FOCUSING ON COMMUNICATION ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND DURING MEETINGS IS THAT THE MAIN GOAL IS CONVERSATION PRACTICE SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO LET YOUR PARTNER SPEAK FREELY EVEN IF THEY MAKE MISTAKES BRYANT RECOMMENDS GIVING ONLY ONE OR TWO CORRECTIONS AFTER EACH PIECE OF DIALOGUE QIU SAYS HE CORRECTS A PARTNER ONLY IF THE PERSON IS STRUGGLING TO THINK OF A WORD OR CANNOT FINISH A SENTENCE IF THEY ARE TRYING TO SPEAK FLUENTLY YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO DISTURB THAT TEMPO SO YOU JUST DEFINITELY KEEP THEM SPEAKING QUI'S ADVICE TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TRY A LANGUAGE EXCHANGE IS SIMPLE DON'T BE AFRAID TO MAKE MISTAKES I'M ALICE BRYANT 
voa-e948c4da-af36-4ff7-8ada-ce5f6a88b5581 WELCOME TO THE VOICE OF AMERICA'S NEWS WORDS THIS WORD IS SOMETHING YOU USE AT MEETINGS AGENDA WHEN NATO LEADERS LAST MET IN CHICAGO AFGHANISTAN WAS AT THE TOP OF THEIR AGENDA AND RUSSIA WAS CONSIDERED A PARTNER IN ADDRESSING ISSUES LIKE TERRORISM AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROLIFERATION THIS YEAR RESPONDING TO RUSSIA'S ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA AND OF INVASION OF EASTERN UKRAINE WILL TOP THE AGENDA AN AGENDA IS A LIST OF WHAT WILL BE DONE OR DISCUSSED AT A MEETING AGENDAS ARE USUALLY USED AT FORMAL MEETINGS LIKE THE ONE IN OUR STORY AN AGENDA CAN BE PERSONAL TOO A SECRET PLAN THAT GUIDES A PERSON'S BEHAVIOR NOW THE NEXT TIME YOU HEAR THE WORD AGENDA YOU WILL KNOW WHAT THIS NEWS WORD MEANS 
voa-e9aeb338-f162-400f-9358-6ec35ef178853 FOR GENERATIONS MANY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE OFFERED CLASSES IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT SUBJECTS HIGHER EDUCATION OFFICIALS BELIEVED THAT BY LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT SUBJECTS STUDENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD AROUND THEM BUT A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS THE CURRENT GENERATION OF COLLEGE STUDENTS MAY NOT VALUE LIBERAL ARTS STUDY PROGRAMS AS MUCH AS EARLIER GENERATIONS IT FOUND MANY CURRENT STUDENTS WANT PROGRAMS THAT DIRECTLY CONNECT TO SPECIFIC CAREER PATHS IN NOVEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN THE SOCIAL RESEARCH COMPANY GALLUP AND THE STRADA EDUCATION NETWORK REPORTED ON AN OPINION STUDY OF THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND AMERICANS RESEARCHERS ASKED THE INDIVIDUALS ABOUT THEIR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES AFTER HIGH SCHOOL THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF THESE MEN AND WOMEN FELT WHATEVER CLASSES OR STUDY PROGRAMS THEY ATTENDED WERE WORTH THE COST OUT OF THOSE WHO COMPLETED A VOCATIONAL PROGRAM MEANING TRAINING FOR A SPECIFIC JOB OR TECHNICAL SKILL FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT STRONGLY AGREED IT WAS WORTH THE COST HOWEVER ONLY FORTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO COMPLETED FOUR YEAR STUDY PROGRAMS AT A TRADITIONAL COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY SAID THE SAME DAVE CLAYTON IS A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT WITH STRADA HE TOLD VOA THE STUDY CONFIRMS EARLIER FINDINGS FROM HIS ORGANIZATION HE SAID IT SHOWS THAT AMERICANS WANT HIGHER EDUCATION TO RELATE TO JOBS IN THE PAST MANY AMERICANS THOUGHT OF HIGHER EDUCATION AS A MEANS OR METHOD OF SELF IMPROVEMENT CLAYTON SAYS A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY WAS TRADITIONALLY A PLACE FOR IMPROVING ONE'S CRITICAL THINKING AND OTHER SKILLS BY LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT SUBJECTS SO WHILE STUDENTS WOULD FOCUS ON ONE CENTRAL SUBJECT LIKE ECONOMICS THEY MIGHT ALSO TAKE CLASSES IN LITERATURE OR PHILOSOPHY FOR EXAMPLE BUT THE COST OF U S HIGHER EDUCATION HAS RISEN OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS NOTES CLAYTON AND THE LABOR MARKET HAS CHANGED A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN EVER BEFORE HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BECOME A REQUIREMENT FOR BETTER PAYING JOBS YET EMPLOYEES CAN NO LONGER EXPECT TO WORK FOR THE SAME COMPANY FOR MANY YEARS AND MAY EVEN NEED TO CHANGE FIELDS MORE THAN ONCE SO CLAYTON ARGUES PEOPLE WANT TO GAIN DEMONSTRABLE SKILLS THAT HAVE SOME KIND OF LONG LASTING VALUE THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO MANY AMERICANS WITH LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES WE HAVE EXPANDED ACCESS TO COLLEGE OVER THE GENERATIONS AND SO THE UPWARD SOCIAL MOBILITY THAT CAN PROVIDE BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH OR ADVANCE THEIR LIVES CLAYTON SAID BUT THIS QUESTIONING OF THE VALUE OF A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION IS NOTHING NEW EVEN IF IT FEELS LIKE A MODERN CONCERN NOTES TIMOTHY BURKE HE IS A CO DIRECTOR OF THE AYDELOTTE FOUNDATION AT SWARTHMORE COLLEGE IN PENNSYLVANIA THE FOUNDATION RESEARCHES AND PROVIDES SUPPORT TO LIBERAL ARTS PROGRAMS BURKE NOTES THAT WHILE AMERICA'S FIRST COLLEGES WERE TEACHING STUDENTS SUBJECTS LIKE LATIN AND HISTORY THEIR STUDENTS WANTED TO LEARN HOW TO BECOME DOCTORS OR ENGINEERS HOWEVER EVEN THE BIGGEST COMPANIES TODAY ARE NOT JUST LOOKING FOR STUDENTS WITH ONE AREA OF SPECIALIZATION IN TWENTY TEN STEVE JOBS CREATOR OF APPLE STATED THAT TECHNOLOGY ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH IT'S TECHNOLOGY MARRIED WITH LIBERAL ARTS THAT YIELDS THE RESULTS THAT MAKE OUR HEARTS SING HE SAID SIMILARLY ANOTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANY GOOGLE LED A STUDY OF ITS OWN LEADERSHIP TEAM IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE AIM WAS TO IDENTIFY THE TOP TEN QUALITIES POSSESSED BY ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL AND EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVES IT LISTED STRONG COMMUNICATION AND LEADERSHIP ABILITIES WELL ABOVE TECHNICAL SKILLS MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD STILL SEE THE U S LIBERAL ARTS APPROACH TO HIGHER EDUCATION AS AMONG THE BEST IN THE WORLD BURKE SAYS IN FACT THE NUMBER OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FOLLOWING THIS MODEL HAS GROWN IN ASIA AND EUROPE IN RECENT YEARS STILL BURKE ARGUES THE PROBLEM REMAINS THAT LIBERAL ARTS PROGRAMS DO NOT DO A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING TO THE PUBLIC WHERE THEIR VALUE LIES EVEN IF THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF EVIDENCE IT'S NOT ANYTHING THAT RELIEVES ANYBODY'S ANXIETY ESPECIALLY IN A TIME WHEN A LOT OF AMERICANS FEAR WITH SOME GOOD REASON THAT OVERALL THE NEXT GENERATION WILL NOT DO BETTER THAN THEIR PARENTS DID FINANCIALLY WHICH IS A NEW SITUATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY HE SAID BURKE SUGGESTS THE WAY FORWARD IS NOT NECESSARILY TO GET LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATORS TO CHANGE WHAT THEY ARE TEACHING INSTEAD THEY NEED TO CHANGE HOW THEY TEACH BY MAKING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE MATERIAL THEY PRESENT IN CLASSES AND ISSUES IN THE REAL WORLD THAT WILL HELP STUDENTS BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN PUT WHAT THEY ARE LEARNING TO USE BURKE ADDS THAT EDUCATORS MUST HELP STUDENTS EXPLAIN THE VALUE THEIR SOFTER SKILLS REPRESENT FOR A FUTURE EMPLOYER FOR EXAMPLE SAYING YOU ARE A STRONG WRITER MIGHT MAKE SENSE BUT THAT DOES NOT REALLY CLARIFY WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THAT SKILL INSTEAD HE SAYS EDUCATORS SHOULD URGE STUDENTS TO LIST MAJOR PROJECTS THEY WERE INVOLVED IN OR WORK THEY PUBLISHED DURING THEIR STUDY PROGRAM THIS DEMONSTRATES THE RESULTS OF A PERSON'S COMBINED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE SAYS BURKE I'M DOROTHY GUNDY AND I'M PETE MUSTO

ONLINE PEARCE SENT HER DAUGHTER TO A PRIVATE CATHOLIC SCHOOL NEARBY IT WAS OFFERING IN PERSON CLASSES NOW PEARCE IS DEBATING WHETHER HER DAUGHTER SHOULD RETURN TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL SHE IS UNSURE OF MOVING AFTER HER DAUGHTER MADE FRIENDS AT THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL SHE IS ALSO WORRIED THE SCHOOL WOULD GO BACK ONLINE IF CORONAVIRUS CASES INCREASE AGAIN PEARCE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IT'S GOING TO BE FINE IF WE STAY WHERE WE ARE AND THAT STABILITY FOR MY FAMILY IS PROBABLY THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO GO MANY SCHOOL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY LOST STUDENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THEY HOPE WHEN SCHOOL STARTS AGAIN THIS FALL FAMILIES WILL CHOOSE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SOME SCHOOLS HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO CONNECT WITH FAMILIES OF YOUNG CHILDREN SOME ARE PLACING SIGNS ALL OVER COMMUNITIES OTHERS ARE REACHING OUT TO FAMILIES WITH DIRECT PHONE CALLS THERE ARE EARLY SIGNS THAT ENROLLMENT MAY NOT RECOVER SAYS A STUDY BY CHALKBEAT AND THE ASSOCIATED PRESS WITH FEWER STUDENTS PUBLIC SCHOOLS COULD RECEIVE LESS MONEY TO OPERATE BUT FOR NOW MONEY FROM PANDEMIC SUPPORT IS KEEPING SCHOOL BUDGETS STRONG CHRIS CRAM IS THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM WHERE PEARCE LIVES HE SAID THE COUNTY HAS LOST BETWEEN THREE THOUSAND AND FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS SINCE LAST YEAR DROPS IN ENROLLMENT COULD ALSO CHANGE THE RACIAL MAKEUP OF THE COUNTRY'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE AP CHALKBEAT STUDY FOUND THAT ENROLLMENT DECLINES VARY BASED ON RACE ENROLLMENT IN PRESCHOOL TO TWELFTH GRADE DROPPED BY TWO POINT SIX PERCENT AMONG FORTY ONE STATES LAST FALL BUT THE DECLINE WAS HIGHEST AMONG WHITE STUDENTS WHOSE ENROLLMENT FELL MORE THAN FOUR PERCENT WHITE FAMILIES' DECISIONS SEEMED BASED MOSTLY ON WHETHER THEIR CHILD'S PUBLIC SCHOOL OFFERED IN PERSON LEARNING STATES WHERE MORE STUDENTS HAD ONLINE CLASSES SAW LARGER DECLINES AMONG WHITE STUDENTS THE COUNTRY'S HISPANIC STUDENT POPULATION SAW THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN ENROLLMENT FROM BEFORE THE PANDEMIC ENROLLMENT DROPPED ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT AMONG HISPANIC STUDENTS A POPULATION THAT HAD BEEN AMERICA'S FASTEST GROWING STUDENT GROUP THAT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS HISPANICS FACED DURING THE PANDEMIC THE GROUP SAW HIGH RATES OF JOB LOSSES AND HIGH RATES OF DEATH AND HOSPITALIZATION FROM THE PANDEMIC AS YOU CAN IMAGINE FAMILIES AND THEIR CHILDREN MADE A WIDE VARIETY OF DECISIONS THAT WERE PANDEMIC RELATED ' CRAM SAID IN AN EMAIL TO VOA CRAM SAID SOME STUDENTS LEFT MONTGOMERY COUNTY TO ATTEND PRIVATE SCHOOL OR HOME SCHOOL HE SAID OTHER FAMILIES LEFT FOR ECONOMIC REASONS MOVING TO LESS COSTLY AREAS IN THE COMING WEEKS WE WILL BE CALLING MAILING AND DOOR KNOCKING TO ENGAGE AND ENCOURAGE THESE FAMILIES TO RETURN CRAM SAID RICHARD WELSH IS A PROFESSOR AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY WHO STUDIES STUDENT ENROLLMENT HE SAID IT COULD BE DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOLS TO RECONNECT WITH FAMILIES WHO LEFT PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR MANY REASONS WELSH SAID SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO FIND DIFFERENT WAYS TO BRING BACK STUDENTS 'WE'RE OPEN FOR BUSINESS AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO IN PERSON LEARNING' COULD BE TARGETED TO WHITE FAMILIES BUT FOR BLACK AND HISPANIC FAMILIES WELSH SAID SCHOOLS ARE TALKING ABOUT SAFETY MEASURES ONE SUCH EFFORT IS GOING ON IN SAN ANTONIO TEXAS THERE THE MOSTLY HISPANIC SCHOOL DISTRICT SAW ENROLLMENT DROP JUST OVER FIVE PERCENT OFFICIALS THERE EXPECT ENROLLMENT WILL RISE THIS FALL BUT NOT TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS TO BUILD TRUST WITH FAMILIES WORRIED ABOUT IN PERSON LEARNING SCHOOL OFFICIALS HAVE HELD TOWN MEETINGS WITH FAMILIES THERE FAMILIES CAN ASK EXPERTS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VIRUS AND COVID NINETEEN VACCINES THE SCHOOL WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO OFFER FULLY ONLINE CLASSES SAN ANTONIO SCHOOL OFFICIALS ARE WORKING TO CONNECT WITH EVERY FAMILY WHO LEFT OR DID NOT ENROLL THEIR CHILD IN PRESCHOOL OR KINDERGARTEN AND PEDRO MARTINEZ HEAD OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SAID THEY ARE CONTACTING FAMILIES BY PHONE OR WITH A HOME VISIT MARTINEZ SAID HE IS CENTERED ON CLASSES FOR YOUNGER STUDENTS WHERE ENROLLMENT DROPPED THE MOST BUT HE IS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT OLDER STUDENTS FROM POOR FAMILIES MANY GOT JOBS TO HELP THEIR FAMILIES DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THEY CONTINUED TO ATTEND ONLINE CLASSES THIS SPRING SO THEY COULD WORK MARTINEZ SAID IT'S SO EASY FOR A SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD TO PRIORITIZE WORK OVER SCHOOL HE SAID CRAM SAID MONTGOMERY COUNTY WILL ALSO OFFER FULLY ONLINE SCHOOL IN PART TO HELP WORKING STUDENTS IT IS UNCLEAR EXACTLY HOW MANY FAMILIES LEFT FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS LIKE PEARCE PRIVATE SCHOOL ENROLLMENT GREW FIVE PERCENT OR MORE THIS YEAR IN STATES LIKE DELAWARE AND NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT IN OTHER STATES INCLUDING NEW YORK LOUISIANA INDIANA AND COLORADO PRIVATE SCHOOL ENROLLMENT FELL BY THREE PERCENT OR MORE IT WAS NOT JUST WEALTHY FAMILIES THAT LEFT PUBLIC SCHOOLS THERE WERE LARGE ENROLLMENT DECLINES AMONG STUDENTS FROM BOTH POOR AND RICH FAMILIES IN THE THIRTY FIVE STATES THAT PROVIDED DATA CRAM SAID SOME STUDENTS WILL BE COMING BACK BUT NOT ALL I'M DAN NOVAK AND I'M CATY

voa-ebf704d7-4861-4a1c-bb25-9cda6d527aff3 ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF A COLLEGE APPLICATION IS A STUDENT'S LIST OF EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES A STUDENT MIGHT BE A MEMBER OF A SPORTS TEAM SPEND TIME TUTORING YOUNGER CHILDREN OR TAKING PART IN A SCHOOL'S THEATER PROGRAM OR SINGING GROUP SOME STUDENTS MIGHT DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS USUALLY AT THIS TIME AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE FINISHING THEIR COLLEGE APPLICATIONS THEY ARE ALSO VISITING UNIVERSITIES AND TAKING ADMISSIONS TESTS LIKE THE SAT BUT THIS IS NOT MOST YEARS SINCE MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT TRAVELING STUDENTS ARE TAKING VIDEO CAMPUS TOURS UNIVERSITIES THAT USED TO TALK TO POSSIBLE STUDENTS IN PERSON ARE DOING SO BY VIDEO CALL INSTEAD ALONG WITH WRITTEN APPLICATIONS UNIVERSITIES ARE ASKING STUDENTS TO SEND VIDEO INTRODUCTIONS SOME SCHOOLS ASKED STUDENTS TO WRITE ABOUT HOW THE PANDEMIC CHANGED THEIR LIVES ONE STUDENT WHOSE LIFE IS DIFFERENT OVER THE LAST TEN MONTHS IS EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD KIDIST BEKELE SHE GREW UP IN ETHIOPIA BUT NOW LIVES IN ANNANDALE VIRGINIA NEAR WASHINGTON D C ON HER APPLICATION SHE WROTE ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE COMING TO AMERICA IN NINTH GRADE BEKELE SAID SHE WANTS TO BE AN ENGINEER AND IS HOPING TO GO TO A UNIVERSITY THAT OFFERS GOOD SCIENCE CLASSES SHE SAID ATTENDING SCHOOL OVER VIDEO MOST OF THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN HARD ESPECIALLY IN SCIENCE AND MATH CLASSES THAT REQUIRE A LOT OF HELP FROM TEACHERS SHE ALSO MISSED THE SUPPORT OF ADULTS AT HER SCHOOL WHO COULD HELP WITH COLLEGE APPLICATIONS COMPLETING HER APPLICATION AT HOME WAS NOT EASY I'M FIRST GENERATION SO MY PARENTS DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL IN HERE SO THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FILL OUT A LOT OF THINGS LIKE THE FAFSA THAT HAVE BEEN VERY HARD BUT AND ALSO FAMILY WISE MY MOM LOST HER JOB AND MY DAD IS THE ONLY ONE WHO WORKS IN OUR FAMILY SO FINANCIALLY IT WAS ALSO KIND OF HARD BUT I'M GETTING THROUGH IT THE FAFSA IS A FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION USED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO FIND OUT IF STUDENTS MAY RECEIVE LOANS GRANTS OR OTHER AID THAT CAN HELP PAY FOR COLLEGE LAURA WELLS IS ONE OF THE ANNANDALE HIGH SCHOOL ADVISORS WHO WORKS WITH STUDENTS LIKE BEKELE ON THEIR COLLEGE APPLICATIONS IN MOST YEARS THE PROCESS BEGINS ONE YEAR BEFORE STUDENTS COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL THEY START WRITING THEIR ESSAYS IN ELEVENTH GRADE THEN THE NEXT YEAR THEY ONLY HAVE TO PREPARE THE APPLICATION WELLS AND HER STUDENTS ARE HURRYING TO FINISH SOME PARTS OF THEIR APPLICATIONS THIS YEAR IN OCTOBER WELLS SAID SHE PUT HER OWN CHILDREN TO BED AND THEN SPENT THE REST OF THE NIGHT MAKING VIDEO CALLS WITH HER STUDENTS SO SHE COULD HELP WITH THEIR APPLICATIONS SHE SAID IT IS MUCH EASIER TO DO WORK ON AN APPLICATION IN PERSON THAN ON A VIDEO CALL MANY STUDENTS WELLS WORKS WITH HAVE PARENTS WHO ARE NOT U S CITIZENS THEY ARE IMMIGRANTS AND HAVE A PERMANENT RESIDENT CARD SOMETIMES KNOWN AS A GREEN CARD AS A RESULT THE TEENAGERS NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS TO INCLUDE WITH THEIR APPLICATION SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO TAKE AN EXTRA TEST TO PROVE THEY CAN SPEAK ENGLISH WELL ENOUGH THE QUESTIONS ARE SO CONFUSING WELLS SAID THE PANDEMIC MADE IT HARD TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATIONS AND WELLS SAID IT LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNGER STUDENTS WHO WANTED TO TRY NEW ACTIVITIES THEY WERE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO APPLY TO A LOT OF NEW CLUBS AND HONOR SOCIETIES THIS YEAR AND A LOT OF THOSE ARE NOT OPERATING SO THE JUNIORS ARE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY WERE REALLY EXCITED TO GET MORE INVOLVED AND BUILD THOSE RESUMES AND THEY JUST HAVEN'T REALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT STUDENTS ARE STILL TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR STANDING EVEN WITHOUT TRADITIONAL RESUME BUILDERS WELLS SAID ONE GROUP WORKED ON A PROJECT FOR AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL ANOTHER ORGANIZED AN EFFORT TO SEND READING MATERIALS TO STUDENTS IN AFRICA BEKELE SAID SHE AND HER FRIENDS FROM EAST AFRICA ORGANIZED AN ETHIOPIAN AND ERITREAN ASSOCIATION AND HELD MEETINGS ONLINE WELLS SAID EVEN IF STUDENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO JOIN CLUBS OR GET INVOLVED IN GROUP ACTIVITIES THERE ARE STILL WAYS TO SHOW AMERICAN COLLEGES THEIR ABILITIES STUDENTS CAN TAKE A FREE ONLINE CLASS FROM A U S UNIVERSITY IN A SUBJECT THAT THEY COULD NOT TAKE AT THEIR OWN SCHOOL THEY CAN DO THESE CLASSES IN THEIR FREE TIME EXTRA ACTIVITIES CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER APPLICATIONS COLLEGES WANT TO SEE THAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT LEARNING THEY WANT TO SEE THAT YOU TAKE INITIATIVE OF YOUR LEARNING RIGHT TO DEVELOP WHATEVER SKILLS IT IS YOU CAN DEVELOP IN THE SPACE THAT YOU HAVE IF YOU CAN ARTICULATE THAT AND STILL SHOW THAT PASSION FOR LEARNING THAT AWARENESS OF YOURSELF AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO COLLEGES AND THE PARTICULAR FORM THAT THAT HAPPENS TO TAKE DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THE PANDEMIC ALSO MADE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WORRIED ABOUT HOW MANY STUDENTS TO ACCEPT SOME STUDENTS ARE PUTTING OFF COLLEGE UNTIL A VACCINE IS AVAILABLE AS A RESULT MANY SMALL COLLEGES ARE WORRIED THEY MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH STUDENTS THOSE COLLEGES ARE MAKING IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO APPLY AND TO BE ACCEPTED OTHER UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO GET INTO LIKE HARVARD ARE WORRIED THAT THEY MAY HAVE TOO MANY STUDENTS LAST YEAR SOME STUDENTS WHO WERE ACCEPTED DECIDED TO WAIT A YEAR THIS YEAR HARVARD OFFERED ACCEPTANCE TO ONLY ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT OF EARLY APPLICANTS LAST YEAR THE SCHOOL ACCEPTED ABOUT FOURTEEN PERCENT OF ITS EARLY APPLICANTS BEKELE OFFERED THIS ADVICE TO STUDENTS WHO WILL BE FILLING OUT THEIR APPLICATIONS NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU LOOK AT GOING TO COLLEGE AND DOING THIS BIG THINGS IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT YOUR GRADES TRY TO PARTICIPATE IN OTHER ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF YOUR SCHOOL IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT YOUR GRADE SO THAT'S WHAT I LOST I DIDN'T DO I COULDN'T GET THOSE KIND OF INFORMATION I'M DAN FRIEDELL

voa-ee212f3c-e195-41f6-b98a-9f52a17147113 A NEW REPORT FINDS THAT MORE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ARE COMING TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER A SHARP DROP BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS HEALTH CRISIS LAST YEAR ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT FEWER INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS STUDIED IN THE U S OR TOOK CLASSES FROM U S UNIVERSITIES ONLINE DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR THAT ENDED LAST SPRING COMPARED TO THE YEAR BEFORE THOSE FINDINGS WERE RELEASED RECENTLY BY THE INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION IIE BASED IN NEW YORK CITY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE U S STATE DEPARTMENT THE IIE PUBLISHED THE YEARLY OPEN DOORS REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE GROUP FOUND THAT STUDENTS ARE COMING BACK TO THE U S ABOUT FOUR PERCENT MORE STUDENTS CAME TO AMERICA FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR COMPARED TO LAST YEAR DURING A PRESENTATION MONDAY THE U S STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE U S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SAID THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC CHANGED EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE A LOT MATTHEW LUSSENHOP IS THE ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S BUREAU OF EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS HE SAID HE IS HOPEFUL ABOUT THE STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE OF THE WORLD'S EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY DURING THE LAST TWENTY MONTHS HE SAID THE U S GOVERNMENT KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE IS TO BUILDING A MORE UNDERSTANDING WORLD WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO EXPAND ACCESS TO GLOBAL LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN STUDENTS SCHOLARS AND RESEARCHERS IIE RESEARCH SHOWED THAT ABOUT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FEWER CHINESE STUDENTS STUDIED AT U S UNIVERSITIES LAST SCHOOL YEAR THAT WAS THE BIGGEST DROP CHINA SENDS THE MOST STUDENTS TO THE U S ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENT POPULATION IN AMERICA COMES FROM CHINA INDIA IS SECOND WITH EIGHTEEN PERCENT THE MOST POPULAR FIELDS OF STUDY FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ARE ENGINEERING MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCE OVER FORTY PERCENT OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS STUDY THOSE SUBJECTS EACH YEAR THE PANDEMIC CUT BY FORTY FIVE PERCENT THE NUMBER OF NEW INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS STUDYING IN THE U S THE REPORT INCLUDED STUDENTS TAKING CLASSES IN PERSON AND THOSE ATTENDING CLASSES BY VIDEO FROM HOME ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FEWER INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WORKED ON GRADUATE DEGREES DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR COMPARED TO THE YEAR BEFORE THE IIE REPORT SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ALREADY STUDYING IN THE U S DID NOT CHANGE VERY MUCH DROPPING JUST THREE PERCENT THE RECENT REPORT WAS NOT AS WORRYING AS SOME PEOPLE EXPECTED BASED ON THE INCREASE IN CORONAVIRUS INFECTIONS OVER THE SUMMER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED THAT A SLOWDOWN IN VISA PROCESSING VACCINATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WERE THE REASONS FOR THE LOWER NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLE VINH LE IS A STUDENT FROM VIETNAM STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HE ONLY MADE IT TO CALIFORNIA ON NOVEMBER FIRST BECAUSE OF TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AT HOME HE WAS NOT ABLE TO GET VACCINATED AND TO HO CHI MINH CITY FOR A FLIGHT TO THE U S INSTEAD HE TOOK CLASSES BY COMPUTER FROM HOME FOR TWO MONTHS HE SAID HIS PROFESSORS WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND HELPED HIM BY RECORDING CLASSES SO HE COULD WATCH THEM IN VIETNAM SOME CHINESE STUDENTS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING CLASSES AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY NYU BUT CANNOT GET TO THE U S ARE USING THE UNIVERSITY'S CENTER IN SHANGHAI FOR STUDY IN NORMAL TIMES THAT CENTER IS USED BY NYU'S AMERICAN STUDENTS STUDYING IN CHINA NYU IS DOING BETTER THAN IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE SCHOOL SAID FOURTEEN PERCENT MORE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ARE

DEGREE HE SAID THOSE STUDENTS INCREASED THE MOST INDIA SENT SEVENTY PERCENT MORE STUDENTS THAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HE CALLED THE NUMBERS A RETURN TO NORMAL FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL POPULATIONS HE SAID THE DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WAS PENT UP LUSSENHOP FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAID THE U S EXPECTS THE INCREASE IN STUDENT INTEREST TO CONTINUE BECAUSE STUDENTS CONTINUE TO VALUE A U S EDUCATION SOME PEOPLE GIVE CREDIT TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN FOR SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS IN JULY U S OFFICIALS INCLUDING SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN AND EDUCATION SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA RECORDED VIDEO MESSAGES THAT WELCOMED INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS TO THE U S RACHEL BANKS IS DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE PLANNING FOR NAFSA AN ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION BASED IN WASHINGTON SHE SAID THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IS TELLING THE WORLD INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE U S EXPERTS ARE WORRIED HOWEVER THAT THE INCREASE IN STUDENTS WILL ONLY HELP SCHOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY POPULAR THEY THINK SMALLER SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES MAY NOT RECOVER ACROSS THE U S THE TWO YEAR SCHOOLS SUFFERED A TWENTY FOUR PERCENT LOSS OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS IN ADDITION RESEARCHERS ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND OUT IF THE JUMP IN STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE PAST THIS SCHOOL YEAR UNIVERSITIES IN CANADA AUSTRALIA AND GREAT BRITAIN WERE

voa-f46f16ef-d1b7-425e-888b-8d6791132f503 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF NURSES THEY PROVIDE ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF ALL HEALTH CARE SERVICES WORLDWIDE AS IMPORTANT AS NURSES ARE MANY COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS NOTED THE HUGE NEED FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS WORLDWIDE ESPECIALLY NURSES AND MIDWIVES EVEN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER ENGLISH SPEAKING NATIONS HAVE MASSIVE SHORTAGES BUT NO MATTER WHAT COUNTRY NURSES WORK IN AT SOME POINT IN THEIR CAREERS THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMMUNICATE IN ENGLISH THE REASON IS SIMPLE THE USE OF ENGLISH IN MEDICAL SETTINGS WORLDWIDE CONTINUES TO GROW WHEN YOU THINK OF NURSES YOU MIGHT IMAGINE HOSPITALS BUT NURSES WORK IN COUNTLESS OTHER PLACES SUCH AS HEALTH CLINICS SCHOOLS PRIVATE HOMES AND ASSISTED LIVING CENTERS THEY WORK ON MILITARY BASES IN REFUGEE CAMPS AND IN DISASTER SITUATIONS AROUND THE WORLD THERE ARE ALSO MANY SPECIALIZATIONS WITHIN NURSING SURGERY CARDIAC CARE ONCOLOGY MIDWIFERY AND ANESTHESIA ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREER NURSES MAY WORK IN ONE OR MANY SPECIALIZED AREAS CHARLOTTE NWOGWUGWU KNOWS ALL ABOUT NURSING HAVING WORKED IN A NUMBER OF SPECIALIZATIONS AND SETTINGS DURING HER THIRTEEN YEARS IN HEALTH CARE SHE HAS SERVED AS A SURGICAL NURSE ORTHOPEDIC NURSE PSYCHIATRIC NURSE AND GLOBAL HEALTH NURSE SHE HAS ALSO TAKEN STUDENTS OVERSEAS FOR THEIR FIELD EXPERIENCE IN GLOBAL HEALTH A NATIVE OF NIGERIA NWOGWUGWU STUDIED NURSING IN THE U S AND HOLDS A DOCTORATE DEGREE IN PUBLIC HEALTH SHE IS NOW ASSISTANT PROFESSOR GLOBAL HEALTH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND SCHOOL OF NURSING SHE JOINS US BY PHONE TO TALK ABOUT NURSING AND SOME OF THE LANGUAGE CHALLENGES AND VICTORIES THAT COME WITH THE JOB THANKS AGAIN FOR BEING WITH US TODAY YOU'RE VERY WELCOME COULD YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU ENJOY MOST ABOUT YOUR WORK AS A NURSING PROFESSIONAL ''‹ ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS THAT I TRULY ENJOY ABOUT NURSING IS THE DIVERSITY IN THE ROLE THE CORE OF WHAT TRULY DRIVES ME IS THE ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY I AM A CARER AT HEART AND IT'S STILL PEOPLE THAT MAKE MY WORK VALUABLE SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE DIVERSITY IN THE ROLE IT REALLY IS CENTERED AROUND CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE AND HOW THAT INSPIRES ME TO KEEP GOING TO DO WHAT IT IS I DO SO I ALWAYS LOOK AT IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE ''“ WHEREBY WHAT IT IS I AM DOING WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL PATIENT IS GOING TO IMPACT THE LIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE NOT JUST THAT PATIENT BUT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS OK GREAT IN A TYPICAL DAY ON THE JOB MAYBE IN AN INTERACTION BETWEEN NURSE AND PATIENT ARE THERE COMMON EXPRESSIONS AND TERMS THAT THEY MIGHT USE ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING AS NURSES IS THAT WE ARE ASSESSING THIS PATIENT THE MOMENT WE WALK IN AND BY THAT I MEAN WE REALLY ARE ASSESSING THEIR LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS WE ARE ASSESSING THEIR PAIN SO TO DO THAT TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS HOW ALERT THE PATIENT IS I WOULD ASK THE PATIENT QUESTIONS LIKE CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME AND WHAT IS YOUR DATE OF BIRTH AND OF COURSE I'VE HAD PATIENTS ''“ MANY VERY MANY ''“ WHO MAY BE A BIT CONFUSED MAYBE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TELL ME THEIR DATE OF BIRTH SO I WOULD FURTHER PROBE AND ASK QUESTIONS LIKE CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT TODAY IS OR WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK IT IS OR WHO THE PRESIDENT IS SO COULD YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF HOW A LANGUAGE BARRIER MAY IMPACT A NURSE'S INTERACTION WITH A PATIENT OR YOU CAN TALK ABOUT WITH A DOCTOR OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SOME NURSES ''“ MAYBE FOR THOSE FROM NIGERIA FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS WHERE I'M FROM WHEN WE ARE SPEAKING TO INDIVIDUALS IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY OR EVEN TO PATIENTS THAT ARE ELDERLY WE A DON'T CALL THEM BY NAME AND B WOULD USE EXPRESSIONS OR PHRASES SUCH AS YES MA AND FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS THEY MAY FIND THAT OFFENSIVE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT FROM A CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE THAT IS ACTUALLY A SIGN OF RESPECT I THINK THAT WHEN WE HAVE NURSES WHO SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE THERE ARE ALSO DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGIES THAT KIND OF MAKE IT CHALLENGING FOR EXAMPLE IT WASN'T UNTIL I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES THAT I UNDERSTOOD THAT PANTS WERE ACTUALLY UNDERWEAR BUT THEN THERE ARE SOME BIASES BETWEEN THE NURSE AS WELL AS THE PATIENT IN TERMS OF 'THE NURSE DOES NOT HAVE A QUOTE AMERICAN ACCENT SO PERHAPS THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE QUALITY OF THE CARE THAT I EXPECT ' SO HOW CAN ''“ OR DO ''“ NURSES OVERCOME SUCH CHALLENGES I THINK THAT NURSES AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE HAVE TRULY DONE AN AMAZING JOB WITH OVERCOMING THIS AND BY THIS I MEAN BECOMING LIFELONG LEARNERS I WAS REALLY OPEN ABOUT MY OWN DEFICITS IN TERMS OF WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I NEEDED TO LEARN BECAUSE THAT TRULY IS ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS TO REALLY BE ABLE TO MAKE THE CHANGE OR IMPROVE YOUR OWN QUALITY AS A NURSE AND YOUR OWN ABILITY TO SPEAK THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE FLUENTLY AND FOR ME ALSO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT I PRACTICE AND A LOT OF NURSES WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY DO DO THAT I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT IT TAKES A VILLAGE SO ADMINISTRATORS IN HOSPITALS ALSO NEED TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE NURSE WORKFORCE AND ALSO IDENTIFY THIS AS YOU KNOW AN AREA OF IMPROVEMENT THAT'S A GREAT VERY THOROUGH ANSWER AND IT PARTIALLY ANSWERS MY NEXT QUESTION SO IF SOMEONE WERE INTERESTED IN THE NURSING FIELD WHAT PATH OF STUDY DO YOU SUGGEST FOR A FOREIGNER WHO WANTS TO BECOME A NURSE IN AN ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS TO MAKE THAT PERSONAL DECISION WHETHER THEY WOULD WANT TO STUDY IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY OR HERE NOW WITH THAT SAID IF AN INDIVIDUAL STUDIES SAY IN SPAIN FOR EXAMPLE OR IN NIGERIA OR WHATEVER COUNTRY IT IS FOR THEM TO BECOME A NURSE ''“ A LICENSED NURSE ''“ HERE THEY STILL HAVE TO TAKE THE BOARD EXAMS SO YA KNOW MY RESPONSE IS REALLY ''“ THEY HAVE TO MAKE THAT PERSONAL DECISION AS TO WHERE THEY WOULD WANT TO GET THEIR DEGREE FROM OK GREAT WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU YOU'RE VERY WELCOME AND IN ADDITION TO HER JOB AS A

voa-f65916bc-0e29-4bed-b676-94b20b9edf223 COMPLETING A DEGREE PROGRAM AT A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY CAN BE ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU DO TO IMPROVE YOUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS IN LIFE HIGHER EDUCATION IS A NECESSITY FOR MANY OF THE BEST PAYING JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES BUT EARNING A DEGREE CAN ALSO BE IN ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS YOU WILL EVER ATTEMPT IN TWENTY NINETEEN A NON PROFIT GROUP NOTED THAT THIRTY SIX MILLION AMERICANS HAD STARTED ON A PATH TOWARDS A DEGREE BUT STOPPED BEFORE COMPLETING THEIR STUDIES THAT NUMBER CAME FROM THE NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE RESEARCH CENTER IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION FOUND THAT THREE MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGHOUT ITS MEMBER NATIONS HAD SUSPENDED THEIR UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE WORLD BANK REPORTED THAT ACROSS SOUTH AMERICA NEARLY HALF OF ALL TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY NINE YEAR OLDS HAD STOPPED ATTENDING HIGHER EDUCATION WITHOUT EARNING A DEGREE AND SOUTH AFRICAN OFFICIALS HAVE REPORTED SIMILAR LEVELS IN THEIR COUNTRY NICHOLE TORPEY SABOE SAYS THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY PEOPLE LEAVE U S HIGHER EDUCATION WITHOUT EARNING A DEGREE AND THE DIFFICULTY OF COLLEGE DEGREE PROGRAMS IS NOT THE TOP REASON PEOPLE GIVE FOR LEAVING SHE ADDS TORPEY SABOE IS DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH FOR THE STRADA EDUCATION NETWORK IN DECEMBER HER GROUP WORKING WITH THE RESEARCH COMPANY GALLUP RELEASED A REPORT ON WHY OVER FORTY TWO THOUSAND AMERICANS LEFT SCHOOL WITHOUT A DEGREE RESEARCHERS FOUND THE MOST COMMON REASON PEOPLE GAVE FOR LEAVING WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF BALANCING WORK WITH THEIR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY STUDIES OTHER REASONS WERE THE HIGH COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE FACT THAT MANY STUDENTS FAILED TO SEE HOW THEIR STUDIES RELATED TO A CAREER TORPEY SABOE SAYS AS FOR WHY SO FEW CONSIDER RETURNING TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION SHE TOLD VOA MANY AMERICANS FEEL THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF THEM SUCCEEDING IF THEY DO THEY ARE AFRAID THAT THEY'VE BEEN AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOM TOO LONG OR THEY'RE JUST WORRIED THAT THE SAME SITUATIONS THAT CAUSED THEM TO DROP OUT BEFORE MIGHT STILL BE THERE AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IF THEY TRY AGAIN SHE SAID TORPEY SABOE SUGGESTS THE PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES IS NOT JUST THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE LESS OF A CHANCE OF FINDING GOOD PAYING JOBS THESE MEN AND WOMEN STILL HAVE TO REPAY LOANS THEY TOOK OUT TO PAY FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND SINCE THEY WILL LIKELY HAVE LESS ACCESS TO BETTER POSITIONS THEY WILL STRUGGLE TO REPAY THAT DEBT THIS MAKES AN ALREADY DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR OR COME FROM AN UNDERREPRESENTED GROUP IN HIGHER EDUCATION THAT MUCH HARDER NOTES JUSTIN ORTAGUS ORTAGUS IS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA IN GAINESVILLE HE BELIEVES THAT STUDENTS LIKE THESE ARE OFTEN THE MOST LIKELY TO DROP OUT IF YOU'RE A LOW INCOME FIRST GENERATION STUDENT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A PARENT TO SAY 'THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO ENROLL' OR 'THESE ARE THE TYPES OF COURSES YOU NEED TO TAKE TO ENSURE YOU'RE UP TO DATE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL MAJOR ' YOU KIND OF HAVE TO LEARN ON THE FLY AND REALLY RELY ON UNDER RESOURCED INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES THAT YOU NEED HE SAID YET ORTAGUS THINKS THERE IS HOPE LAST MONTH HE AND TWO OTHER UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA RESEARCHERS RELEASED A STUDY ON EFFORTS TO RE ADMIT STUDENTS AT TWO YEAR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGES LARGELY SERVE POOR AND MINORITY STUDENTS MANY WHO ARE WORKING IN FULL TIME POSITIONS AND SUPPORTING FAMILIES FEDERAL STUDIES SHOW THAT ONLY ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO START THEIR EDUCATION AT SUCH SCHOOLS EARN A DEGREE HOWEVER THE STUDY SHOWED THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE ABLE TO HELP STUDENTS RETURN IN TWO WAYS FIRST THE SCHOOLS STARTED SENDING TEXT MESSAGES TO OVER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FORMER STUDENTS ON THEIR MOBILE PHONES THE MESSAGES PROVIDED LINKS SO THEY COULD IMMEDIATELY ENROLL IN CLASSES OR GET ADVICE ABOUT THE NEXT BEST STEPS IN THEIR EDUCATION THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALSO OFFERED TO PAY STUDENTS FOR THEIR FIRST CLASS ONCE THEY DECIDED TO RETURN TO SCHOOL THE TEXT MESSAGES ALONE HAD LITTLE EFFECT BUT THE TWO EFFORTS TOGETHER MADE THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE STUDY TWENTY ONE PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO RE ENROLL ORTAGUS ARGUES THAT THIS DEMONSTRATES HOW A LITTLE FINANCIAL AID IN THIS CASE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS CAN DO A LOT FOR THOSE IN NEED AND EVENTUALLY THE COST TO THE SCHOOL IS COVERED WHEN THE STUDENTS ARE IN A BETTER POSITION TO PAY FOR THE REST OF THEIR EDUCATION NICHOLE TORPEY SABOE SAYS THESE EFFORTS ARE A GOOD START BUT SHE ARGUES THERE ARE STILL GREATER CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE TO THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF U S HIGHER EDUCATION TORPEY SABOE SAYS ONE CAN SEE EVIDENCE OF THIS IN THE GROWING POPULARITY OF INTERNET BASED DEGREE PROGRAMS SHE THINKS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES NEED TO CONSIDER OFFERING MORE CLASSES OUTSIDE OF NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS AND SHE SAYS LAWMAKERS NEED TO CONSIDER GIVING MORE MONEY TO SCHOOLS THAT SERVE NEEDY STUDENTS SO THEY CAN IMPROVE THEIR GUIDANCE SERVICES I'M DOROTHY GUNDY AND I'M PETE MUSTO

UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI'S THE MANEATER NEWSPAPER IN THE FALL HE EXPLAINED THAT STUDENT PAPERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A CONNECTION TO STUDENTS THAN SCHOOL OFFICIALS OR TOWN NEWSPAPERS DO WE KNOW OF STUDENT HOSPITALIZATIONS THAT THE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE SELF REPORTED TO THE UNIVERSITY HE SAID AND HOFF NOTED STUDENT REPORTERS FEEL MORE RESPONSIBLE TO REPORT THAT KIND OF INFORMATION JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE ACCESS TO IT MATT COHEN IS A FORMER SPORTS REPORTER FOR THE INDIANA DAILY STUDENT AT INDIANA UNIVERSITY IN BLOOMINGTON HE BEGAN REPORTING ABOUT OTHER SUBJECTS WHEN MOST COLLEGE SPORTS WERE CANCELED BEING STUCK ON ZOOM IS HARD SAID COHEN ABOUT USING ONLINE VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TRYING TO REALLY BE IN DEPTH IN YOUR REPORTING WHEN YOU CAN'T BE THERE NEWS REPORTING WAS NOT MEANT TO BE DONE VIRTUALLY HE ADDED WRITING ABOUT ONE'S FELLOW STUDENTS CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR STUDENT REPORTERS COHEN SAID FRATERNITY AND SORORITY STUDENTS AT HIS SCHOOL NEVER WANT TO TALK TO ME OR THE MEDIA BECAUSE WE ALWAYS MAKE THEM LOOK BAD AND THEY'RE NOT WRONG THAT'S TRUE BUT HE SAID THEY WERE ALSO DOING STUPID THINGS LIKE HAVING PARTIES OF ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC THERE IS NOT REALLY A WAY TO MAKE THAT LOOK GOOD HE NOTED COHEN SAID SOME OF THESE GROUPS CRITICIZED HIM WHEN HE WROTE ABOUT THE SUSPENSION OF STUDENTS AFTER FOOTBALL GAME CELEBRATIONS THERE WAS EVEN A MEME MADE ABOUT HIM THE SPORTS AND POPULAR CULTURE WEBSITE IU BARSTOOL PUBLISHED A MEME ON TWITTER MAKING FUN OF COHEN HE SAID HE TOOK IT IN GOOD HUMOR COLLEGIATE

FOUND THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REPORT THEIR OWN CORONAVIRUS CASES TO THE SCHOOL SO OUR NUMBERS LOOK REALLY GOOD BUT ARE THEY REFLECTING WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS WE'RE ASKING THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS MAYLEBEN SAID HIS NEWSPAPER ALSO WROTE AN OPINION PIECE IN TWENTY TWENTY ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE FROM THE UNIVERSITY AND WHAT STUDENTS SHOULD EXPECT FROM IT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM PRESIDENT MUN CHOI BLOCKED STUDENTS ON TWITTER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE AUTUMN TERM HE WAS REACTING TO CRITICISM FOLLOWING HIS HANDLING OF THE VIRUS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS THE BLOCKING IS OF CONCERN BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT'S TWITTER ACCOUNT IS USED TO SEND PUBLIC INFORMATION AND IN A PANDEMIC THAT'S EXTRA IMPORTANT SAID HOFF SCHOOLS FILED WHAT IS CALLED A SUNSHINE REQUEST TO GAIN ACCESS BY MORNING CHOI HAD UNBLOCKED EVERYONE HOFF SAID IT WAS GREAT TO SEE AND THEY WERE PROUD THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO LEGALLY PROVE IT WAS A PUBLIC ACCOUNT HIS NEWSPAPER HAS ALSO DONE SOME OPINION PIECES THAT STRONGLY CRITICIZED UNIVERSITY DECISION MAKERS AT THE START OF THE FALL TERM FOR EXAMPLE THE NEWSPAPER CALLED FOR THE RESIGNATION OF A TOP UNIVERSITY OFFICIAL MEGAN MITTELHAMMER IS NEWS EDITOR FOR THE RED AND BLACK AN INDEPENDENT STUDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA OR UGA SHE SAID ACCOUNTABILITY WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE PUBLICATION DURING THE FALL TERM BEFORE THE START OF THE SEMESTER A UGA HOUSING EMPLOYEE DIED OF COVID NINETEEN BUT MITTELHAMMER SAID THE UNIVERSITY REFUSED TO GIVE THE NAME OF THE PERSON OR ADMIT THAT COVID NINETEEN WAS THE CAUSE OF DEATH SO THE NEWSPAPER FOUND OUT THROUGH THE LOCAL CORONER AND A LOT OF STUDENTS PROFESSORS AND EMPLOYEES WERE CLEARLY UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT EXPLAINED MITTELHAMMER UGA SAID THE SCHOOL'S POLICY PREVENTED IT FROM COMMENTING ON THE DEATH OF AN EMPLOYEE SHE SAID MITTELHAMMER SAID THE RED AND BLACK ALSO REPORTED ON THE DEPENDABILITY OF UGA'S COVID NINETEEN SELF CHECK TOOL DAWGCHECK PROFESSORS EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT A POSITIVE COVID NINETEEN TEST THROUGH DAWGCHECK BUT SOME PEOPLE DO NOT SHE SAID FOR MOST STUDENT NEWSPAPERS THE PANDEMIC HAS ALSO PUSHED REPORTERS INTO A VIRTUAL NEWSROOM THIS HAS OFTEN DELAYED PRODUCTION AND MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR TEAM MEMBERS TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS MANSOOR AHMAD IS AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT FROM PAKISTAN HE IS ALSO THE PHOTO AND WEB EDITOR FOR THE REPORTER AT MINNESOTA STATE UNIVERSITY AT MANKATO HE SAID BETWEEN HIS CLASSES AND WEEKLY NEWSPAPER MEETINGS HE HAS SPENT TOO MUCH TIME ON ZOOM MANEATER'S MANAGING EDITOR HOFF SAID THAT WORKING VIRTUALLY HAS MADE IT HARD TO BUILD A SENSE OF FRIENDSHIP WITHIN THE TEAM IT IS HARD WHEN THE ONLY CONTACT WITH WRITERS IS THROUGH GOOGLE DRIVE COMMENTS SAID HOFF SO HE TRIES TO BE EXTRA FRIENDLY IN
