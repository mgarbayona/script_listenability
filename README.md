## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains code and data used to evaluate how well **readability-based text measures** can capture the **listenability** (or comprehensibility) of online spoken language learning materials.  
The study explored the relationship between **expert-assigned difficulty levels** and automatically computed **readability scores** from spoken transcripts, including those generated via automatic speech recognition (ASR).

Key aspects:
- Comparison of four text-based measures: *Flesch Reading Ease*, *Daleâ€“Chall Readability*, *Lensear Write*, and *McAlpine EFLAWâ„¢ Readability*.
- Evaluation using **Voice of America (VOA) Learning English** news materials.
- Analysis of robustness when using **automatically generated transcripts** (Kaldi ASpIRE and Google Web Speech API).
- Classification experiments predicting VOA difficulty levels from readability scores.
